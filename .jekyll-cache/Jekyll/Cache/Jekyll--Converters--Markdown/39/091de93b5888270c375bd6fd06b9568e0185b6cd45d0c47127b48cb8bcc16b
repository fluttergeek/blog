I"ã<p>Cocoapods makes your build times slower and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve taken the liberty of trying Carthage. Well, from the instructions Iâ€™ve read in bigger frameworks like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Realm</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FacebookCore/FacebookLogin</code>, it is a daunting process. Which is why it took me this long to want to even bother with it. But for some smaller frameworks, it is almost similar to Cocoapodâ€™s process, which I like better. Unfortunately, this arduous shift took painfully long to install the frameworks. Every time I add a new framework to my <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cartfile</code> and update carthage, it downloads everything and builds everything over again. My gahd!</p>
