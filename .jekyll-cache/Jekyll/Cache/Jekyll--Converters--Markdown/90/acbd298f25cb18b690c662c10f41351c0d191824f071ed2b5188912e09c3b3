I"Ä<p>A list of whoâ€™s who in the iOS development industry. I know, it sounds a bit much. Please, allow me to fanboy for a bit. This order has no criteria, we donâ€™t want comparing these legends. I mostly found them on YouTube. I may not list the ones who post on Medium, since I have not made any connection with their personalities not that Iâ€™ve talked to any of these guys on the list.</p>

<h2 id="1-brian-voong-aka-lets-build-that-app">1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuP2vJ6kRutQBfRmdcI92mA">Brian Voong a.k.a. Letâ€™s Build That App</a></h2>

<p>He makes a lot of tutorials on YouTube and he makes it really simple to understand. He has his website where you can subscribe to his courses, though, I find his courses pricey.</p>

<h2 id="2-sean-allen">2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbTw29mcP12YlTt1EpUaVJw/featured">Sean Allen</a></h2>

<p>Like Brian, he also creates video tutorials. I was torn between putting him in the first spot but like I said, this isnâ€™t a comparison. His courses are also really well put. He doesnâ€™t sell courses, but he has patreon. Thatâ€™s where people usually pay him for their suggestions on his next tutorial. He started making <code class="highlighter-rouge">Swift News</code> since 2018 which covers a whole lot of perspective on the Swift trend or anything in relation.</p>

<h2 id="3-meng-to-aka-designcode">3. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTIhfOopxukTIRkbXJ3kN-g">Meng To a.k.a. DesignCode</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1100/1*T9UxcYliq4LLnqPjT1-9Hg.png" alt="legend" /></p>

<p>Heâ€™s like the all around guy teaching designers how to code and developers how to design. He covers React, Flutter and Swift apps. Heâ€™s the one Sean reached out to for sponsorship on a particular video about how Sean learned SwiftUI. A lot of his content is more into designing. He uses a lot of tools to teach designers like ProtoPie.</p>

<h2 id="4-scott-smith">4. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqndzS37vNHVrqLVAKEP2HQ">Scott Smith</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D3_oxNPUUAATIAJ?format=png&amp;name=small" alt="legend" /></p>

<p>Another great iOS developer tutor. He has only begun to teach SwiftUI since July. His content are superb.</p>

<h2 id="5-kyle-lee-aka-kilo-loco">5. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv75sKQFFIenWHrprnrR9aAhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv75sKQFFIenWHrprnrR9aA">Kyle Lee a.k.a. Kilo Loco</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://ytimg.googleusercontent.com/vi/19_6FBMTagI/mqdefault.jpg" alt="legend" /></p>

<p>The most entertaining coder youâ€™ll see. Head on to his tutorials and youâ€™ll see why. Heâ€™s got merch, podcast, membership to his courses and a YouTuber of course, thatâ€™s how I found out about him. Heck, thatâ€™s how I found out about everyone. Not to mention, he is passionate about coding.</p>

<h2 id="6-codewithchris">6. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/CodeWithChris">CodeWithChris</a></h2>
<p><img src="https://codewithchris-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/img/chrishomepage.png" alt="legend" /></p>

<p>This one is an O.G. in the game. Heâ€™s built a school in this field and you can sign up for one of his courses. They have teacher support and all that good stuff. Not to mention, Chris also has a lot of tutorials on YouTube just like the rest of these guys.</p>

<p>He is a senior iOS developer with more than 8 years of experience in building scalable, high quality iOS apps. He likes to build out projects from scratch in code. Itâ€™s important for him to create meaningful apps that impact the life of users in a positive way. According to his website, Rebeloper.com, he works alongside <code class="highlighter-rouge">Agatha</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Alpar</code>, cool superhero names, huh?</p>
