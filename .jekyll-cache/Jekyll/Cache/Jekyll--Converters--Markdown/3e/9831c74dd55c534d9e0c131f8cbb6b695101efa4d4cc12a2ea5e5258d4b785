I"ì<p>First of all, thanks to Scott Smith for helping me understand this. I know it can be another learning curve to start learning SwiftUI if youâ€™ve only begun diving into becoming an iOS developer. Itâ€™s daunting at first, but I hope it can be simple too for many newbies. Now, I havenâ€™t gotten my hands on Mac OS Catalina yet, so I canâ€™t actually demonstrate my own version of this tutorial properly if I canâ€™t show you the canvas, which isnâ€™t available in Mojave yet, myself.</p>
