I"u<p>The first time I encountered the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">Swift Package Manager</code> was just a few days ago while searching for alternative ways to install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Firebase</code> framework in my project. I thought <code class="highlighter-rouge">Carthage</code> was a holy grail. Boy, am I wrong now that I’ve seen how to install frameworks with Swift Package Manager. Unfortunately, Firebase doesn’t have a swift package yet. Not officially, anyway. They have started trying to make the support since months ago, but no prorgress has been done months after. Crazy! I know.</p>
