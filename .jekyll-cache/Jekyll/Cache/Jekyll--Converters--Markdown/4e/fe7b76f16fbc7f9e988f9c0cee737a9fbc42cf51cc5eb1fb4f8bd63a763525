I"µ<p>Letâ€™s get one thing straight now baby. Local notifications is not the same as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Push</code>/<code class="highlighter-rouge">Remote</code> notifications. It is also not the same as the Notification-Observer relationship which I will discuss <a href="/blog/notification-and-observer-the-basics/">next</a>. They differ because local notifications donâ€™t need triggers coming from outside the app. Either way, youâ€™ll still need the <code class="highlighter-rouge">UNUserNotificationCenter</code>, and for that, you need to import <code class="highlighter-rouge">UserNotifications</code>. This is usually used in scheduling apps like alarm and todo-list.</p>
