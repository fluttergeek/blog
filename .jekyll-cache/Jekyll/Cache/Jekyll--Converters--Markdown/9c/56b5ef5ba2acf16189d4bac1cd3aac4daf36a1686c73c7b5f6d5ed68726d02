<p>The first time I encountered the word <code class="highlighter-rouge">Swift Package Manager</code> was just a few days ago while searching for alternative ways to install the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Firebase</code> framework in my project. I thought <code class="highlighter-rouge">Carthage</code> was a holy grail. Boy, am I wrong now that I’ve seen how to install frameworks with Swift Package Manager. Unfortunately, Firebase doesn’t have a swift package yet. Not officially, anyway. They have started trying to make the support since months ago, but no prorgress has been done months after. Crazy! I know.</p>

<p>The process of adding a framework to your project with SwiftPM is pretty straightforward. Note that I use <code class="highlighter-rouge">framework</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">package</code> interchangeably. Get the git url from the framework’s github that is SwiftPM supported. Then in your Xcode, go to <code class="highlighter-rouge">File » Swift Packages » Add Package Dependency</code>. Enter the git url and click <code class="highlighter-rouge">next</code>. You will be given an option to choose the latest version or from another branch, typical <code class="highlighter-rouge">Github</code> jargon really.</p>

<p>That wasn’t so hard was it? No more typing on that freaking terminal or creating a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Podfile</code> or a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cartfile</code>. Everything is handed to you by Xcode now. And like, basically, everyone can easily create their own packages and push them to github. I never really had any idea how those pods came to be published or approved after being made by their creators, but this time everyone gets to be creator &gt;:)</p>

<p>And while there’s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">cocoapods.org</code>, there’s also <a href="https://swiftpack.co/">swiftpack.co</a> to look for existing packages. Alamofire and SwiftyJSON are some of the familiar packages listed in that repository. However, there are still plenty of packages that you might need that are not yet supporting SPM. I have this project with more than 10 dependencies, but only one of them supports SPM and that is <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cosmos</code>.</p>

<p>There’s a ridiculously simple explanation on how to create a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Swift Package</code>:</p>
