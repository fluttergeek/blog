I"G<p>Instead of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code> as your not equal, you can or should use <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOT</code> instead. I’m writing this post because I just can’t seem <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code> to work as part of my predicate. I was struggling to find a way to make not equal to work. I looked it up in the documentation. Even though <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code> is in there, I could not make it work. However, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> sign worked. Weird. And so, I did something like this.</p>
