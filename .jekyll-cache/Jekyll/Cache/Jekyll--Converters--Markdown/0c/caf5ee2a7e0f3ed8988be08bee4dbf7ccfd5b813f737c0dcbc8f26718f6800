I"U	<p>I’m in no position to give any advise on creating designs because I’ve never been a designer. I only code my way through Xcode and I’ve only begun trying to deploy an app on the App Store. I have been, for months, trying to design my app inside the storyboard. It’s pretty difficult, considering that I frequently need to launch the simulator to see the full splendor of my design. It takes painfully long to build, really, but I don’t regret having been able to experience it. I learned so much about how constraints work on the storyboard. But not designing, no. My designing skills did not improve at all.</p>

<p>I was really skeptic about wireframing and prototyping. Just now, I think I’m doing what designers call prototyping. I’m starting to do it because I’m tired of clicking my way through the storyboard and it lags sometimes.</p>

<p>Now, I’m exploring the possibility of designing some aspects of my app in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sketch</code>. It feels lightweight to use, loads up pretty fast and nothing lags. Cool, right? I just create an artboard that would match the screen size of, say, an iPhone SE. The font size I’m using in Xcode is exactly the font size I’m able to use in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sketch</code>. All the shapes and sizes are portable by setting the artboard’s screen size to an iPhone-like screen. Feels great to be able to explore colors and shapes much faster.</p>

<p>Since I’m not really a designer, I take most of my design insights from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dribbble</code>. I don’t copy the exact designs. However, it’s nice to know which colors complement each other and how shapes will mix and match the other shapes around it. That’s what I’ve been up to in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Dribbble</code>. More often than not, I improvise my own design and it turns up like shit. Now that I’m trying it with <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sketch</code>, it seems to be more plausible to make descent outcome out of my improvisations. I can see the results so fast, I don’t need a simulator for it.</p>

<p>For icons, I prefer using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/icons8-lite/id786188363?mt=12">Icons8</a>. It’s an app that allows me to easily drag icons directly from the app to my Assets.xcassets or to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Sketch</code>.</p>
