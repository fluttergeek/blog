I"m<p>This is by far the best CMS for Jekyll I have discovered. It only takes a few clicks to get it up and running, unlike Jekyll-admin/manager and Netlify. I still haven’t found a workaround the error I’m getting with <code class="highlighter-rouge">/.forestry/settings.yml</code>. It keeps saying <code class="highlighter-rouge">Invalid yaml syntax</code>.</p>
