<p>Cocoapods makes your build times slower and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve taken the liberty of trying Carthage. Well, from the instructions Iâ€™ve read in bigger frameworks like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Realm</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">FacebookCore/FacebookLogin</code>, it is a daunting process. Which is why it took me this long to want to even bother with it. But for some smaller frameworks, it is almost similar to Cocoapodâ€™s process, which I like better. Unfortunately, this arduous shift took painfully long to install the frameworks. Every time I add a new framework to my <code class="highlighter-rouge">Cartfile</code> and update carthage, it downloads everything and builds everything over again. My gahd!</p>

<p>Apart from that, I didnâ€™t know that I had to take this extra step for each of the framework Iâ€™m using.</p>

<p>If I didnâ€™t import all of them there, Iâ€™d get this error.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s also another step you have to do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to Build Phases</li>
  <li>Click <code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> and add New Run Script Phase</li>
  <li>Type <code class="highlighter-rouge">/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks</code> in the ginormous textarea under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Shell /bin/sh</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Weâ€™re not done yet. Phew! For every framework you add, you also need to add their location in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">input files</code>. For this, I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">Carting</code>. It creates a <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcfilelist</code> for input files and output files for all of it. <a href="https://github.com/artemnovichkov/Carting">Check it out</a>.</p>

<p>There were a few frameworks that just doesnâ€™t work with Carthage, those being:</p>
<ol>
  <li>GMStepper - No carthage available</li>
  <li>BetterSegmentedControl - Error during Carthage installation</li>
  <li>Firebase - They will not be maintaining their Carthage archives anymore. Theyâ€™d rather invest it on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Swift Package Manager</code>, though Iâ€™d still have to look it up one day.</li>
</ol>

<p>For these three, I maintained the use of Cocoapods. It can works hand in hand with Carthage.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ve noticed any changes, because Firebase is the heaviest framework I have and it is installed with Cocoapods, thereby still making my build time really slow. Apart from that, I donâ€™t really see the rest of the frameworks build anymore. I guess thatâ€™s an improvement.</p>
