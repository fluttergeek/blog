I"r<p>I’m in no position to give any advise on creating designs because I’ve never been a designer. I only code my way through Xcode and I’ve only begun trying to deploy an app on the App Store. I have been, for months, trying to design my app inside the storyboard. It’s pretty difficult, considering that I frequently need to launch the simulator to see the full splendor of my design. It takes painfully long to build, really, but I don’t regret having been able to experience it. I learned so much about how constraints work on the storyboard. But not designing, no. My designing skills did not improve at all.</p>
