I"=<p>One of my favorite online tutors is Let’s Build That App. He’s really good with his YouTube thing going on. Makes me understand a lot of Swift stuff that I never imagined to be digging into. Most of this article is coming from his tutorial and I’ve also included his video in case anyone’s interested.</p>
