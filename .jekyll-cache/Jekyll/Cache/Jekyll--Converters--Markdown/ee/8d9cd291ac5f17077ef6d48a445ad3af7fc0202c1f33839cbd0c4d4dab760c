I"²<p>I call the <code class="highlighter-rouge">signOut()</code> to sign out, but thereâ€™s really a lot of things going on inside my call. Iâ€™m not sure which is the correct way to do this yet, but what Iâ€™m trying to achieve is once Iâ€™m signed off, my login view will not automatically sign me back in. My login view checks if the access token contains a token, and if it does, then automatically sign me in and performSegue.</p>
