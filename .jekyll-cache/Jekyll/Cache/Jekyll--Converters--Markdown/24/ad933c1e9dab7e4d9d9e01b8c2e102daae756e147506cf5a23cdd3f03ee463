I"x<p>I was hesitant in making a change at first, since I just started blogging using Jekyll. Looking at how updates are freshly being added to the jekyll-admin library made me think it’s more intuitive. I am wrong. However, the upgrades done in jekyll-manager isn’t really all that drastic. They still haven’t got a fix for when selecting the image metadata. It is still http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/…jpg when I select an image from the static files. I wonder why they haven’t dealt this yet. This should have been the turning point of their fork. Instead, a few UI changes have been made. Some, impressive.</p>
