I"a<p>I was hesitant in making a change at first, since I just started blogging using Jekyll. Looking at how updates are freshly being added to the jekyll-admin library made me think itâ€™s more intuitive. I am wrong. However, the upgrades done in jekyll-manager isnâ€™t really all that drastic. They still havenâ€™t got a fix for when selecting the image metadata. It is still http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/â€¦jpg when I select an image from the static files. I wonder why they havenâ€™t dealt this yet. This should have been the turning point of their fork. Instead, a few UI changes have been made. Some, impressive.</p>

<p>This is my favorite part about jekyll-manager and to be honest, the only thing I care about, really. Directories can be navigated to now, therefore making uploading a hell of a lot easier, now that Iâ€™m confident to use this dashboard for uploading images. I no longer have to drag and drop using Finder for this.</p>

<p>The metadata too has changed. It is, by default, hidden and expandable. Itâ€™s quite confusing why itâ€™s called a <code class="highlighter-rouge">FRONT MATTER</code>, instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">metadata</code>. And by default too, <code class="highlighter-rouge">layout</code> is the first metadata youâ€™ll be able to see. Thereâ€™s a select dropdown for the choices for <code class="highlighter-rouge">layout</code>. Since in our config.yml, layout is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code> by default, then you can choose to remove this metadata field. <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags</code> has this cool feature that allows you to select from previous used tags. However, this feature is still buggy. I found a bug when I try removing a word. It removes the previous word instead of the current word (tag) that needs removing. Itâ€™s just sad that it doesnâ€™t work the same with <code class="highlighter-rouge">categories</code>. Hence, when typing multiple categories, just separate them with spaces and not a comma.</p>

<p>The text editorâ€™s panel for tools is now dark but overall, it works the same and still no Grammarly functionality. I mean <code class="highlighter-rouge">Grammarly</code> is disabled when using the text editor, but not on other text fields.  Bummer.</p>

<p>For the most part, it looks almost exactly like jekyll-admin and better, but I donâ€™t understand why there isnâ€™t any noticeable changes in jekyll-admin that will make it better than the 2 years ago maintaned code of jekyll-manager.</p>

<p>You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening <code class="highlighter-rouge">Automator</code>. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">workflow</code>, then choose to run shell script like so:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-02%20at%209.07.22%20PM.png" alt="shell" /></p>

<p>Type in what youâ€™d normally type on your terminal.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /Directory/To/Your/Blog
source ~/.bash_profile
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:4000/admin</code> on your browser. Thatâ€™s how youâ€™ll know if it works. And if it does, you may close the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Automator</code> and itâ€™ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github.</p>
