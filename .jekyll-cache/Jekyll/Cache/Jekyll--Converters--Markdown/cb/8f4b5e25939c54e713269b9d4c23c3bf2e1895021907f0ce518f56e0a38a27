I"ð<p>Instead of using <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code> as your not equal, you can or should use <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOT</code> instead. Iâ€™m writing this post because I just canâ€™t seem <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code> to work as part of my predicate. I was struggling to find a way to make not equal to work. I looked it up in the documentation. Even though <code class="highlighter-rouge">!=</code> is in there, I could not make it work. However, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code> sign worked. Weird. And so, I did something like this.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>let filter = "(status = 'Pending' OR (status = 'Washed' AND (pad = 2 OR pad = 3))) AND NOT cancel = 'Cancelled' AND NOT ownerId = ''"
orders!.filter(filter)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, youâ€™ll see <code class="highlighter-rouge">NOT</code> placed before the attribute. I donâ€™t know why it works that way, but it works anyway.</p>
