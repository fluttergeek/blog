I"G<p>You might encounter this problem after cloning with Carbon Copy Cloner. You’ve also come here because you’re trying to make the cloned hard drive bootable. Well, you’re in luck. The problem lies with the partition scheme you’ve used. If you’ve set your Disk Utility’s view to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Show Only Volumes</code>, then it would look like this:</p>

<p>You have no option to choose the partitioning scheme of your choice, but if you set the view to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Show All Devices</code> then you’ll see this option like so:</p>

<p>Since you want your disk to be bootable, then set your scheme to <code class="highlighter-rouge">GUID Partition Map</code>. If you chose Master Boot Record, you’ll have no EFI volume hence not bootable. You will then be able to fill your new partition with say a Mac OS or Hackintosh.</p>
