I"à<p>I just discovered a way for two apps to communicate with each other with the use of UserDefaults. I thought that UserDefault is only available locally in the app. Sandboxed in its own environment.</p>

<p>The two apps should add <code class="highlighter-rouge">Groups</code> capability each.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/R7HLz.png" alt="group" /></p>

<p>The group container string should start with <code class="highlighter-rouge">group</code>. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">group.theCommonContainer</code>. Itâ€™s just like a url which apps with the groups capability can access, provided that their container must have <code class="highlighter-rouge">group.theCommonContainer</code>. But of course, it could be named anything else other than <code class="highlighter-rouge">theCommonContainer</code>.</p>

<h2 id="access">Access</h2>

<p>In order to access the UserDefault that is being shared by the apps, access UserDefaults this way:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>let groupDefaults = UserDefaults(suiteName: "group.theCommonContainer")

// reading something from key
let username = groupDefaults?.string(forKey: "something")
</code></pre></div></div>
