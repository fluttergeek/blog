I"n<p>I’ve had my Xcode projects in the HDD drive ever since. Today, I transferred them to my SSD thinking it would solve my problem. But yeah, I guess it would load my codes faster since it’s already loading my storyboard faster, but there’s a ton of things that Xcode would launch aside from just your code and whatever you’ve put in your project folder.</p>
