I":<p>As a developer, Iâ€™d like to host my portfolio somewhere free and somewhere familiar to developers. Oh wait! I know where that is. These templates are forkable and for each one of these, thereâ€™s a link to their repositories. You wonâ€™t find much if you look into Jekyll Portfolio Themes. Been there, done that. Nada! These templates are going to come up in google search results, but itâ€™s better to see them in all in one place.</p>

<p>If I may be so bold to place this as number 1. Iâ€™m currently using this template as my portfolio. This repo contains an easy-to-customize personal dev portfolio template that was created with Sass and JavaScript. It is lightweight and fully responsive, as well as comes with the Bootstrap grid system and loaded with Font Awesome. The site is static and comes production ready if you just want to add your information and go. Alternatively, you can edit styles, colours, and scripts fairly easily. The site was built as modular as possible to make it easy to shift around styles and content.</p>
