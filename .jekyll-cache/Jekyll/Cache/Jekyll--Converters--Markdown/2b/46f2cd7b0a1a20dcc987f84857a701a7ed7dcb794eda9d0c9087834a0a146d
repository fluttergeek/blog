I"®<p>I just found one of the best guides to prepare for your interview. I found out about this in Sean Allenâ€™s Swift News. Though I wouldnâ€™t recommended relying on this alone, in case you need to prepare for an interview, because there are other aspects of iOS development that needs perusing.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t always find Ray Wenderlichâ€™s site a great place to look for tutorials. Some of the contents do baffle me sometimes. Although, itâ€™s still a good place to start learning programming, Swift especially. This resource, <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/762435-swift-interview-questions-and-answers">Swift Interview Questions and Answers</a>, is a good find for me though. Itâ€™s a good place to start learning or refreshing your knowledge on the most utilized methods of using the Swift language. Itâ€™s kind of like a flashcard wherein answers are hidden, then you press the reveal button to get an explanation.</p>

<p>The explanations are superb! Itâ€™s not always just a bunch of paragraphs, some have a bunch of examples every step of the way and explained in the simplest-to-understand manner. I mean who needs more explaining when thereâ€™s the easy to understand examples. I wish there is a similar resource for <code class="highlighter-rouge">GCD</code> because it is tough for newbies.</p>
