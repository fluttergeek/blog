I"º<p>As a developer, Iâ€™d like to host my portfolio somewhere free and somewhere familiar to developers. Oh wait! I know where that is. These templates are forkable and for each one of these, thereâ€™s a link to their repositories. You wonâ€™t find much if you look into Jekyll Portfolio Themes. Been there, done that. Nada! These templates are going to come up in google search results, but itâ€™s better to see them in all in one place.</p>
