I"i<p>I bought the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Wireless Vertical Mouse Game 800/1600/2400DPI Mice 2-Button</code> a couple of weeks ago and it just a arrived a week ago. I bought mine in <a href="https://shopee.ph/product/76803954/1920543944">Shopee</a>. It’s a marketplace here in the Philippines. I bought it for only Php 445 including freight. That’s like almost USD 10. This is brandless and it charges like how you charge with your phone. I guess its battery lasts for a week, or maybe it just turned off. It says in Shopee that it should last more than a month. So, I just recharged mine again today.</p>
