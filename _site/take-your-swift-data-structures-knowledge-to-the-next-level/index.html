First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here. Sick of dealing with hosting companies? GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all. What is Jekyll?: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server. Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free. "

We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.  Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave.

Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

    "body": "The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post. ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: {% highlight ruby %}def print_hi(name) puts “Hi, #{name}”endprint_hi(‘Tom’)#=&gt; prints ‘Hi, Tom’ to STDOUT. {% endhighlight %} Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at Jekyll’s GitHub repo. If you have questions, you can ask them on Jekyll Talk. "

    "body": "A list of who’s who in the iOS development industry. I know, it sounds a bit much. Please, allow me to fanboy for a bit. This order has no criteria, we don’t want comparing these legends. I mostly found them on YouTube. I may not list the ones who post on Medium, since I have not made any connection with their personalities not that I’ve talked to any of these guys on the list. 1. Brian Voong a. k. a. Let’s Build That App: He makes a lot of tutorials on YouTube and he makes it really simple to understand. He has his website where you can subscribe to his courses, though, I find his courses pricey. 2. Sean Allen: Like Brian, he also creates video tutorials. I was torn between putting him in the first spot but like I said, this isn’t a comparison. His courses are also really well put. He doesn’t sell courses, but he has patreon. That’s where people usually pay him for their suggestions on his next tutorial. He started making Swift News since 2018 which covers a whole lot of perspective on the Swift trend or anything in relation. 3. Meng To a. k. a. DesignCode: He’s like the all around guy teaching designers how to code and developers how to design. He covers React, Flutter and Swift apps. He’s the one Sean reached out to for sponsorship on a particular video about how Sean learned SwiftUI. A lot of his content is more into designing. He uses a lot of tools to teach designers like ProtoPie. 4. Scott Smith: Another great iOS developer tutor. He has only begun to teach SwiftUI since July. His content are superb. 5. Kyle Lee a. k. a. Kilo Loco: The most entertaining coder you’ll see. Head on to his tutorials and you’ll see why. He’s got merch, podcast, membership to his courses and a YouTuber of course, that’s how I found out about him. Heck, that’s how I found out about everyone. Not to mention, he is passionate about coding. 6. CodeWithChris: This one is an O. G. in the game. He’s built a school in this field and you can sign up for one of his courses. They have teacher support and all that good stuff. Not to mention, Chris also has a lot of tutorials on YouTube just like the rest of these guys. "

    "title": "Weak Self vs Unowned Self",
    "body": "2019/10/15 - Most articles regarding this are overwhelming and I’m about to make it easier. This is based on Brian Voong’s tutorial. I urge you to watch the video too because, essentially, that is what I’m basing this article on. In his tutorial, there are two views. One trying to present the other, the other view has a button to go back to the first view. His objective in this tutorial was to simply demonstrate how the presented view is removed from memory when popping back to the previous view by the use of [weak self] or by [unowned self]. His closures are a bit too advanced to understand, so let’s make it more conceptual than actual. Say this is the presented view. class 2ndView: View {	deinit {		print( The memory used by this view is being released )	}		self. viewDidLoad (){		closure {() in			self. alert()		}	}		func alert() {. . . }}By doing it like this, the self in the closure, by default, holds a strong reference to itself, being the 2ndView. And when it does that, it simply makes it difficult to relase the 2ndView from the memory when going back to the 1stView. And by strong, it means the deinit won’t be working here. In order to make the reference to 2ndView less strong, we use weak by replacing our closure to this: closure { [weak self] () in	self?. alert()}Notice that we made the self an optional. By using weak, we can’t guarantee that self always has a value. If we are certain that self always returns a value, then we can use unowned. closure { [unowned self] () in	self. alert()}Both solves the same memory problem and will print out The memory used by this view is being released every time the 2ndView is unloaded. This can also be done for variables pointing to classes. Let’s have an example of the 1stView: class 1stView: View {	weak var 2ndView: View?		self. viewDidLoad() {		navigationController?. pushViewController(2ndView(), animated: true)	}}1stView = nil// The memory used by this view is being releasedAfter unloading the 1stView, our 2ndView is also unloaded ang gives us the printed message from its deinit. Here’s a post by Antoine v. d. SwiftLee 🚀 which explains what ARC does behind the curtains. "

    "title": "Using Vertical Mouse: My Take",
    "body": "2019/10/15 - I bought the Wireless Vertical Mouse Game 800/1600/2400DPI Mice 2-Button a couple of weeks ago and it just a arrived a week ago. I bought mine in Shopee. It’s a marketplace here in the Philippines. I bought it for only Php 445 including freight. That’s like almost USD 10. This is brandless and it charges like how you charge with your phone. I guess its battery lasts for a week, or maybe it just turned off. It says in Shopee that it should last more than a month. So, I just recharged mine again today. Does it fix the arm strain problem? I think it does. As a programmer, I thought I was having carpal tunnel syndrome. This happened to me during 2016 after graduating from college. My hands would become painful and even more painful each day. Until I stopped programming. It took me many months of pregabalin/gabapentin and Vitamin B complex to heal from it. It wasn’t fully gone but I was more relieved. I went to med school after that, and I haven’t encountered the pain again. We don’t use keyboards and mouse that much in med school. Then after 2 years, I decided it’s not for me at all. The past few months I’ve been trying to get back to programming. The pain starts coming back, so I minimized my computer usage to keep the pain away the day after. I realized that putting my keyboard closer to my lap did the trick. It removed most of the pain. I got more into coding and there is pain when I’m holding the mouse for so long. I guess I shouldn’t have rested my palms on top of the mouse if I wasn’t really using it. But that just doesn’t solve the problem because I will be programming for long hours. After trying the vertical mouse, things starts to change pretty quickly. I no longer feel the strain in my hands and arms. It reduced the pain to like 90%. The other 10% is when I use the vertical mouse for much longer hours but it’s not all that painful and it subsides easily. All these years I thought I had carpal tunnel syndrome. I was misdiagnosed by a Rheumatologist here in Zamboanga. You know why? I told him I have this pain and it includes my pinky and my finger joints as well. He refuses to diagnose it with anything else but CTS. I know it wasn’t CTS because my pinky is included which shouldn’t be the case if it really was CTS. As for this vertical mouse model, well, it is brandless and you get what you pay for. I’m not sure why it hangs a bit when I load up a lot of windows or when I’m running out of RAM. It’s not that much of a problem though. Most of the time it doesn’t hang. But when it does, the left click button kind of acts like a right click and then it feels laggy and not to mention, the scrolling too. For the most part, I’m satisfied with my mouse. It is a wireless mouse, but like most wireless mouse, you need that tiny usb thingy plugged in your computer that allows it to be wireless. Not bluetooth. "

    "title": "Context Menu in SwiftUI",
    "body": "2019/10/15 - This is one of the coolest things you’d see in an iOS app. Context Menus, like the one showed in the picture, was something that I thought could only happen with App Icons. It turns out they work within the app too. It simply works like alertsheet. Like alertsheet, it is a collection of buttons but now with images attached to them too. The action is also encapsulated within the button. The best part is you no longer have to use a nasty looking closure to make that happen. import SwiftUIstruct ContentView: View {  var body: some View {    Image( pic ). resizable(). frame(height: 300)      . cornerRadius(20). padding()      . contextMenu {        VStack {          Button(action: {            print( save )          }) {            HStack {              Image(systemName:  folder. fill )              Text( Save To Gallery )            }          }          Button(action: {            print( send )          }) {            HStack {              Image(systemName:  paperplane. fill )              Text( Send )            }          }        }      }    }  }}You could not only use it in images, but also with labels among other things. These things are probably not solid yet, so they might crash your app. Now everything looks cleaner than building one on UIKit. It’s just that these brackets kind of make me dizzy. But don’t fret, you can compartmentalize these things with your programming prowess. Example was taken from KAVSOFT: "

    "body": "2019/10/14 - The first time I encountered the word Swift Package Manager was just a few days ago while searching for alternative ways to install the Firebase framework in my project. I thought Carthage was a holy grail. Boy, am I wrong now that I’ve seen how to install frameworks with Swift Package Manager. Unfortunately, Firebase doesn’t have a swift package yet. Not officially, anyway. They have started trying to make the support since months ago, but no prorgress has been done months after. Crazy! I know. The process of adding a framework to your project with SwiftPM is pretty straightforward. Note that I use framework and package interchangeably. Get the git url from the framework’s github that is SwiftPM supported. Then in your Xcode, go to File » Swift Packages » Add Package Dependency. Enter the git url and click next. You will be given an option to choose the latest version or from another branch, typical Github jargon really. That wasn’t so hard was it? No more typing on that freaking terminal or creating a Podfile or a Cartfile. Everything is handed to you by Xcode now. And like, basically, everyone can easily create their own packages and push them to github. I never really had any idea how those pods came to be published or approved after being made by their creators, but this time everyone gets to be creator &gt;:) And while there’s a cocoapods. org, there’s also swiftpack. co to look for existing packages. Alamofire and SwiftyJSON are some of the familiar packages listed in that repository. However, there are still plenty of packages that you might need that are not yet supporting SPM. I have this project with more than 10 dependencies, but only one of them supports SPM and that is Cosmos. There’s a ridiculously simple explanation on how to create a Swift Package: "

    "title": "Enums For Beginners",
    "body": "2019/10/13 - Enums can be confusing for everybody, especially the newbies. I mean, why use those when you can just create variables and constructs. It does the same right? Some claim that they use enum to make their code type-safe, error free and easy to use. I guess that would be true if an app is becoming perplexingly complex. In basic form, it can look like this: enum Directions {  case north  case south  case east  case west} // Defining multiple cases on a single line enum Directions {   case north, south, east, west }Cool, so what then? How and why would you want to use those? After calling forth Directions. north with a print, you’ll just see this in the console  north\n . You might wonder why is this even useful? It’s like calling a variable inside of a struct type. Let’s move on to Raw Values. We now know that cases will return a string. Aside from it, it can also return a rawValue. Just how do we do that? It’s easy, just inherit from a type by doing something like this: enum Directions: Int. Now when you print(Directions. north. rawValue), you’ll get 0. It’s just like Directions became some sort of array and north is indexed at 0.  Here’s another example for that: enum AnimationCurve: Int {  case easeInOut, easeIn, easeOut, linear}print(AnimationCurve. easeIn. rawValue)//  1\n The next example will not be able to inherit from types to call rawValues from cases. enum Directions {  case north(String)  case south(latitude: Double, longitude: Double)  case east(String)  case west(String)} var digitalCompass = Directions. south(latitude: -120. 83, longitude: 37. 0)print(digitalCompass)When printed, this will give a value of  south(latitude: -120. 83, longitude: 37. 0)\n . Neat huh? So, basically it’s a string. Cases are a f***ing string with like no spaces because they are also variable names at the same time! Genius! How do we get the values inside of the parenthesis? Is there some kind of rawValue mechanism we can use for this? As a matter of fact, there is! We can print a form of string from the values inside of these parentheses. If you trust me on this, we can print out Latitude is 0. 5, while longitude is 0. 6 just by printing print(Directions. south(latitude: 0. 5, longitude: 0. 6). description). We just have to extend this enum like it’s some kind of construct and create a computed property, we chose to use the word description as you can see. It can be anything actually. extension Directions {  var description: String {    switch self {    case . sorth(let direction):      return direction    case . south(let latitude, let longitude):      return  Latitude is \(latitude), while longitude is \(longitude)     case . east(let isItReally):      return  The direction is \(isItReally)     case . west(let westeros):      return  King's landing is in \(westeros)     }  }}print(Directions. south(latitude: 0. 5, longitude: 0. 6). description)There’s another way to simply do this without having to call the computed property description directly. We can inherit this extension from CustomStringConvertible, like this: extension Directions: CustomStringConvertible {  var description: String {, but the computed property should be description. If you use another variable name instead of it, then you will not be able to use CustomStringConvertible’s feature. Now all you have to do to get the same result is print out Directions. south(latitude: 0. 5, longitude: 0. 6) without the description after it. That’s the idea of how to return strings out of enums with parentheses. The let latitude, let longitude are just parameter names. If you’ve noticed, it can actually be named anything too. Now that we know how to work with enums. There are other things you can do with it too, like comparing complex enum’s value to a similar type of enum. This is a tutorial by Károly Nyisztor and it teaches just that. Thanks to BeCodable, Károly Nyisztor and Antoine v. d. SwiftLee 🚀. The examples come from their posts. Take your enums knowledge to the next level by clicking on their names, it links to their post about enums. Since my intention about this post is to just bridge the gap between beginners to learning the essence of enums, these guys will do you better with more examples and applications on how it really works.

    "title": "Sign In With Apple Swift 5 Tutorial",
    "body": "2019/10/12 - First of all, a big thanks to Kilo Loco’s tutorial. Check it out. Not only is this feature available for iOS 13 up, it’s also available for Mac OS 10. 15. This is my favorite feature in iOS 13. Being able to sign in with the option of privacy. Why is that? Well if you use this feature in your app, your user will be able to use a dummy name and a garbage email address. The garbage email address generated by Apple will forward emails to the email associated with the user’s Apple ID. It’s not necessarily the user’s @icloud. com email. It could be his gmail. And of course, the user doesn’t have to change his name to something else and he can opt to use the Apple associated email. As of now, the only information this feature can use are full name and email. All the user really has to do, if privacy isn’t the top concern, is click continue with password and then enter the password for your Apple ID. Once the user is done, click continue and voila! So here’s how to do that with UIKit in Swift: Go to signing and capabilities -&gt; add Capability -&gt; Sign In with Apple import AuthenticationServices in two files, in the model and view controller. // User. swift // Modelstruct User {  let id: String  let firstName: String  let lastName: String  let email: String  init(credentials: ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential) {    self. id = credentials. user    self. firstName = credentials. fullName?. givenName ??       self. lastName = credentials. fullName?. familyName ??       self. email = credentials. email ??     }}Notice that only credentials. user is non-optional, and that’s because it is the only guaranteed thing to come out of this. At this point, we don’t know yet what is defined in the scope of what we want to get from our User. Now let’s add the sign in button, though Apple has already got us covered on this. It already has its own height. You can’t manually add this on your storyboard, so you’ll have to programmatically code it and programmatically key in the constraints as well. But basically, this is what you’ll need to create the sign in button: let appleButton = ASAuthorizationAppleIDButton()appleButton. translatesAutoresizingMaskingIntoConstraints = falseappleButton. addTarget(self, action: #selector(didTapAppleButton), for: . touchUpInside)view. addSubview(appleButton)That’s basically what you’ll need to make the button appear. Now let’s make it functional @objc func didTapAppleButton() {  let provider = ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider()  let request = provider. createRequest()  request. requestScopes = [. fulName, . email]		  let controller = ASAuthorizationController(authorizationRequests: [request])  controller. delegate = self  controller. presentationContextProvider = self  controller. performRequest()}The next thing to do is to extend from two delegates: ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate and ASAuthorizationControllerPresentationContextProviding. extension ViewController: ASAuthorizationControllerPresentationContextProviding {  func presentationAnchor(for controller: ASAuthorizationController) -&gt; ASPresentationAnchor {    return view. window!  }}extension ViewController: ASAuthorizationControllerDelegate, didCompleteWithAuthorization authorization: ASAuthorization) {  switch authorization. credential {  case let credentials as ASAuthorizationAppleIDCredential:    let user = User(credentials: credentials)    performSegue(withIdentifier:  goToHome , sender: user)  default: break  }}That’s pretty much all you have to do to get Sign In with Apple working, basically. Now, you may have heard, if you watched Kilo Loco’s tutorial, about an autologin which I haven’t seen him done a tutorial on it. It would be just like checking if the credential exists or not. I looked it up and here it goes: let appleIDProvider = ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider()appleIDProvider. getCredentialState(forUserID: userIdentifier) { (credentialState, error) in  switch credentialState {  case . authorized:    // The Apple ID credential is valid. Show Home UI Here    break  case . revoked:    // The Apple ID credential is revoked. Show SignIn UI Here.     break  case . notFound:    // No credential was found. Show SignIn UI Here.     break  default:    break  }}If you want to go over sending your users some email, then you’ll have to configure it further inside your Apple Developer Account. "

    "title": "Experience With Carthage As Opposed To Cocoapods",
    "body": "2019/10/11 - Cocoapods makes your build times slower and that’s why I’ve taken the liberty of trying Carthage. Well, from the instructions I’ve read in bigger frameworks like Realm and FacebookCore/FacebookLogin, it is a daunting process. Which is why it took me this long to want to even bother with it. But for some smaller frameworks, it is almost similar to Cocoapod’s process, which I like better. Unfortunately, this arduous shift took painfully long to install the frameworks. Every time I add a new framework to my Cartfile and update carthage, it downloads everything and builds everything over again. My gahd! Apart from that, I didn’t know that I had to take this extra step for each of the framework I’m using.  If I didn’t import all of them there, I’d get this error.  There’s also another step you have to do:  Go to Build Phases Click + and add New Run Script Phase Type /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks in the ginormous textarea under Shell /bin/shWe’re not done yet. Phew! For every framework you add, you also need to add their location in the input files. For this, I used Carting. It creates a xcfilelist for input files and output files for all of it. Check it out. There were a few frameworks that just doesn’t work with Carthage, those being:  GMStepper - No carthage available BetterSegmentedControl - Error during Carthage installation Firebase - They will not be maintaining their Carthage archives anymore. They’d rather invest it on Swift Package Manager, though I’d still have to look it up one day. For these three, I maintained the use of Cocoapods. It can works hand in hand with Carthage. I’m not sure I’ve noticed any changes, because Firebase is the heaviest framework I have and it is installed with Cocoapods, thereby still making my build time really slow. Apart from that, I don’t really see the rest of the frameworks build anymore. I guess that’s an improvement. "

    "body": "2019/10/11 - I’m in no position to give any advise on creating designs because I’ve never been a designer. I only code my way through Xcode and I’ve only begun trying to deploy an app on the App Store. I have been, for months, trying to design my app inside the storyboard. It’s pretty difficult, considering that I frequently need to launch the simulator to see the full splendor of my design. It takes painfully long to build, really, but I don’t regret having been able to experience it. I learned so much about how constraints work on the storyboard. But not designing, no. My designing skills did not improve at all. I was really skeptic about wireframing and prototyping. Just now, I think I’m doing what designers call prototyping. I’m starting to do it because I’m tired of clicking my way through the storyboard and it lags sometimes. Now, I’m exploring the possibility of designing some aspects of my app in Sketch. It feels lightweight to use, loads up pretty fast and nothing lags. Cool, right? I just create an artboard that would match the screen size of, say, an iPhone SE. The font size I’m using in Xcode is exactly the font size I’m able to use in Sketch. All the shapes and sizes are portable by setting the artboard’s screen size to an iPhone-like screen. Feels great to be able to explore colors and shapes much faster. Since I’m not really a designer, I take most of my design insights from Dribbble. I don’t copy the exact designs. However, it’s nice to know which colors complement each other and how shapes will mix and match the other shapes around it. That’s what I’ve been up to in Dribbble. More often than not, I improvise my own design and it turns up like shit. Now that I’m trying it with Sketch, it seems to be more plausible to make descent outcome out of my improvisations. I can see the results so fast, I don’t need a simulator for it. For icons, I prefer using Icons8. It’s an app that allows me to easily drag icons directly from the app to my Assets. xcassets or to Sketch. "

    "title": "Notification And Observer: The Basics",
    "body": "2019/10/09 - This topic is not about Local Notifications or Push Notifications. It is about creating triggers. This is a straightforward snippet of how you call a trigger or the one-liner that notifies the observer: // Trigger/NotifierNotificationCenter. default. post(name: NSNotification. Name. init( done ), object: nil)This will look for an observer that will allow you to send this trigger an action. It is looking for an observer named done. Let’s create that too: // ObserverNotificationCenter. default. addObserver(self, selector: #selector(sortAndStopLoading(n:)), name: NSNotification. Name. init( done ), object: nil)Now this is something you’d probably find in the viewDidLoad of your ViewCotroller. Just to create an observation to catch the trigger with the name done and provides an action when the trigger has been called. Let’s create that action too: // Action@objc func sortAndStopLoading(n: NSNotification) {    done += 1        if done == 2 {      print( reached )      self. sales = self. sales. sorted(by: {($0[ number ] as! Int) &gt; ($1[ number ] as! Int)})      self. stopLoading()    }  }Never mind the content of my function. What is important here is you know how the selector’s given function will actually look like. If you were wondering what is inside my function, it is simply just waiting for the trigger to call this function two times from maybe two different sources of thread that call the same trigger. When both threads are done, then we can sort the array’s contents and tuck away the loader image. If your ViewController is done observing, and we disappear from this view or something, we should remove this observer like so: deinit {  NotificationCenter. default. removeObserver(self, name: NSNotification. Name. init( done ), object: nil)}or like this override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {  NotificationCenter. default. removeObserver(self, name: NSNotification. Name. init( done ), object: nil)}Don’t you know? There’s another way to make an observer that does not involve calling another function to make an action action. It calls the action inside its closure: NotificationCenter. default. addObserver(forName: NSNotification. Name(rawValue:  done ), object: nil, queue: . main) { [weak self] (notification) in   done += 1       if done == 2 {    print( reached )    self. sales = self. sales. sorted(by: {($0[ number ] as!

WWDC in June 2018 introduced the Network framework available from iOS 12 onwards which includes the NWPathMonitor class, which we will be using in this tutorial. Here’s a straight forward example of the basic implementation on how to check for internet connection. import Networkprivate let monitor = NWPathMonitor()monitor. start(queue: queue)monitor. pathUpdateHandler = { path in  if path. status == . satisfied {    print( Online )  } else {    print( Offline)  }It’s so much shorter than the previous baffling solutions that you can find on stackoverflow. Previous solutions had to be particular about the connectivity. If it’s coming from a WiFi, 4G, 3G or cellular data. My previous way of checking the internet connection was to use Alamofire’s network reachability feature which was way simpler than the other solutions, but I added a library that only uses this one feature. Hence, longer build time for something thatI didn’t necessarily need. Now you don’t even have to worry for the most part. It’s just that simple code that allows you to check for internet connectivity. Now, I created something to allow me to check for the internet connection in different parts of my project without having to import Network all the damn time. func online(completion: @escaping (Bool) -&gt; Void) {  let monitor = NWPathMonitor()  let queue = DispatchQueue. global(qos: . background)  monitor. start(queue: queue)  monitor. pathUpdateHandler = { path in   var err = true   defer {    completion(err)    monitor. cancel()   }   if path. status == . satisfied {    err = false   } else {    self. showError(message:  Offline! :( )    err = true   }  }}Note that the we have to cancel the network monitoring that’s been in the background thread, if you want to stop checking for the internet connection. If you don’t cancel it, every time the connectivity changes, your monitor. pathUpdateHandler will execute itself again. I created this inside a singleton which allows me to call this method simply, anywhere, like this: Singleton. sharedInstance. online { (err) in  guard err == false else { return }		  // Do whatever online}There’s a more elaborate article discussing how the Network framework can be used.

    "body": "2019/10/08 - I’m currently on Mojave and I just thought that it’s time I use an app for messenger. It takes quite a while to load Facebook messenger on my Chrome browser. Maybe it’s just my internet speed. So I looked for an app on the Mac App Store and there’s not much apps out there for native Mac OS app look of Messenger. This is probably the only one out there. The only one I’ve found at least. I’ve scrolled deep enough to see there’s no other like it. It has decent amount of stars as rating, but does it really live up to it? What can I say? It really looks native, but it is half-baked. Here’s why:  The login fields look alright, but the placeholder doesn’t say the username can be accepted too. It’s just Email and phone number.  The login button is especially horrible looking. Just a plane white button with no rounded edges. Its font is too thin and the spacing around the text of the button is just not well thought of.  As you can see on the photo, the user’s icon is overlapping the window frame’s buttons.  Some text like Chat is meant to be brighter on this dark mode. It definitely looks more suited to the light mode.  The light mode is actually more gray than white. Other than that, I’m satisfied with the app. I bought it for only a dollar. I’m going to keep on using it because it’s way faster than loading the messenger website. UPDATE:: Thanks to u/Auttoh and aadillyas for responding on my Reddit link post of this blog post. They both gave me a tip on a similar app but not found on the app store. It’s from a github link. Caprine is an unofficial and privacy-focused Facebook Messenger app with many useful features. As you can see, I didn’t have to pixelate the names of my friends because they have this feature to hide names and avatars. It also allows you to follow the system’s appearance of your mac. Say you are in dark mode, the app will also be in dark mode. If you changed your system’s appearance to light mode, the app will also turn light mode. You can also choose to make its mode independent from the system’s appearance.  There’s also a compact mode on this app which hides away the names if your window is tinier. Only pictures of your friends will be shown on the side.  It looks way more sophisticated than Chatmate but it doesn’t feel as snappy. It is build on javascript/Electron hence it is not native. Although, it looks native enough actually. There are still some features that load like a web page, like when choosing stickers or when loading a conversation from another friend. After a day of using it, I realized how long it takes to open the app. I see a dark empty window first for a maybe 15 to 30 seconds until t loads the messenger web page. Goofy is another unoffical Messenger mac app. It is also Electron based. It could be faster because it has much less features than Caprine, obviously.  That’s Goofy for you! Now that I’ve tried Goofy too, I can say it really is much lighter. The whole thing after logging in is just a browser. It looks similar to Caprine actually but as I said, way way less features. This is the lightest among other non-native Messengers. Now here’s something I’d like to introduce to you. I’m not sure what this is built on, but it is faster than Caprine, but I wish it had Caprine's awesome features. The only thing I love about it is that it loads much faster. Franz is the former Emperor of Austria - but also a messaging app that combines chat &amp; messaging services into one application. Franz currently supports Slack, WhatsApp, WeChat, Facebook Messenger, Telegram, Google Hangouts, GroupMe, Skype and many more.  It feels lighter than Caprine, but the messenger part is simply a web app of the official Messenger. Hence, it still isn’t a native solution. How it feels when using the web app is the exact same feel when using Franz and I can say that it feels much master than Caprine when loading the stickers. The only downside I can find is that it just keeps asking you to purchase Franz Professional.  It went like this out of nowehere like a screensaver, and I waited 10 seconds for it to go back to messenger mode. It basically does this every time you open up Franz. "

Today, my blog is still not indexed by google, but my half-baked portfolio iosjunkie. com is. Which is weird. One of the tips of some YouTuber was to post your links on Reddit. I was hesitant at first because I felt like it would be kind of like spamming on the internet, but that YouTuber said that it would help index my blog faster, and so I did. So, it happens that there are three ways to post on Reddit, just like the numerous ways to post on Facebook. You can post a link, image, or a text. No wonder I’ve been seeing so many links only posts on Reddit. I thought they were spammy. The way it works is just copy and paste a link to the Url field. Once you’re done, the title field will automatically fill itself out, then submit. You can’t upload a thumbnail on the link you posted. It is also automatically generated coming from your link’s image metadata. Just brilliant! However, you can’t really post links everywhere. There are some topics that you won’t be allowed to post links to. The second link post was what I posted on my blog just yesterday. I just thought people would try to find it because it is a more recent issue with Xcode 11, and so people did find it really quick. Now I have 16 karmas just for a day of using Reddit. Whatever the hell that means. So it is true that it is easier for your blog to be found if you post on Reddit. My first link post was a tutorial and I was sure people were going to find it more helpful, but as it turns out, no one bothered to touch it yet. I’m still sure that posting it on Reddit will help that post be seen than not having posted it on Reddit. And. . surprise. . surprise! My blog views also went up really high. At least, the highest it has been since creation.  This feels great actually. It feels like I’m already indexed by Google and like people are already flocking into my blog. Someone also recently just gave me a tip for my other blog post, hence I updated my blog post, and now, it has a more flavorful content. Dang, I’m really feeling like a legit blogger now. "

    "title": "Basic Implementation of Local Notifications",
    "body": "2019/10/08 - Let’s get one thing straight now baby. Local notifications is not the same as Push/Remote notifications. It is also not the same as the Notification-Observer relationship which I will discuss next. They differ because local notifications don’t need triggers coming from outside the app. Either way, you’ll still need the UNUserNotificationCenter, and for that, you need to import UserNotifications. This is usually used in scheduling apps like alarm and todo-list. // AppDelegate. swiftimport UserNotifications@UIApplicationMainclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {  var window: UIWindow?  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication. LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&gt; Bool {    // Override point for customization after application launch.         if #available(iOS 10. 0, *) {     // For iOS 10 display notification (sent via APNS)     UNUserNotificationCenter. current(). delegate = self     let authOptions: UNAuthorizationOptions = [. alert, . badge, . sound]     UNUserNotificationCenter. current(). requestAuthorization(      options: authOptions,      completionHandler: {_, _ in })    } else {     let settings: UIUserNotificationSettings =     UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [. alert, . badge, . sound], categories: nil)     application. registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)    }				    return ApplicationDelegate. shared. application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)  }}We must have this in our AppDelegate. swift first. It asks permission from the user if he is okay yo receiving notifications from your app. That request will allow alert, badge, and sound. Depending on how much you want the user to experience the notification. You can omit sound or the other types for example: [. alert, . badge]. Next is the fun part, and you can choose to put it wherever your app needs it. // 1. Preparing our notification contentlet content = UNMutableNotificationContent()content. title =  Hey kid content. body =  Where's your parents? content. sound = UNNotificationSound. default()content. badge = 1// 2. Preparing when our notification would firelet date = Date(). addingTimeInterval(5)let dateComponents = Calendar. current. dateComponents([. year, . month, . day, . hour, . minute, . second], from: date)// 3. Preparing what argument will trigger the notification to come uplet trigger = UNCalendarNotificationTrigger(dateMatching: dateComponents, repeats: false)// 4. Combining all the preparations into one requestlet uuidString = UUID(). uuidStringlet request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: uuidString, content: content, trigger: trigger)// 5. Finally, execute the requestlet center = UNUserNotificationCenter. current()center. add(request) { (err) in  guard err == nil else { return }  // Whatever you want to do after firing that badass notification}This algorithm is broken down into five parts. :  Create the content. That’s what the user can see in your notification.      The badge is the red circular thing on the top right corner of your app’s icon with the number of how many notifications were fired up.     Setting when to fire up the notification. If you print them out, this is how they’ll look like:      8 Oct 2019 at 2:53 AM  // darw   year: 2019 month: 10 day: 8 hour: 2 minute: 53 second: 26 isLeapMonth: false // dateComponents   You can create your date component this way to be more specific about the date: DateComponents(year: year, month: month, day: day)    Create a trigger and add the when to it. You can make it repeat its time interval by setting repeat to true.  It’s possible that there may be many requests of triggers, hence we needed that id. UUID() is one hell of a one liner that can give you a random string. You can use it anywhere actually. It gives off something like this:  31A7BADF-93F8-40A0-B642-DEDE7BD6179B\n  if you print it.  Finally we may now make the request appear more tangible and we need the current instance of our notification center to allow such a thing to happen. To add buttons on your notification:  Add something like this to step 1: content. categoryIdentifier =  alarm  Add something like this before step 5:  let show = UNNotificationAction(identifier:  show , title:  Tell me more… , options: . foreground)let category = UNNotificationCategory(identifier:  alarm , actions: [show], intentIdentifiers: [])center. setNotificationCategories([category])   And make sure your ViewController conforms to UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate to catch the response coming off from the user’s chosen action on the button. func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {  // pull out the buried userInfo dictionary  let userInfo = response. notification. request. content. userInfo  if let customData = userInfo[ customData ] as? String {    print( Custom data received: \(customData) )    switch response. actionIdentifier {    case UNNotificationDefaultActionIdentifier:      // the user swiped to unlock      print( Default identifier )    case  show :      // the user tapped our  show more info…  button      print( Show more information… )      break    default:      break    }  }  // you must call the completion handler when you're done  completionHandler()}Thanks to CodeWithChris and Paul Hudson @twostraws for making me understand how to actually do this.

We created an OperationQueue even though we only have one operation to execute, which is runLocationBlock.  Suspend the operation or pause first to check if we are allowed to request location data.  Whatever is in the runLocationBlock will only run if operationQueue is unsuspended but rest assured this function is already running. extension ViewController: CLLocationManagerDelegate {  private func configureLocationManager() {    locationManager. desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest    locationManager. delegate = self				    // requestLocation will take 10 seconds to run, but only requests location just once    locationManager. requestLocation()				    // startUpdatingLocation will fire up immediately    // locationManager. startUpdatingLocation()  }		  func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError error: Error) {    print( error )  }    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus) {        //If we're authorized to use location services, run all operations in the queue    // otherwise if we were denied access or restricted or location is not determined, cancel the operations				    if(status == . authorizedWhenInUse || status == . authorizedAlways) {      self. operationQueue. isSuspended = false    }else if(status == . denied || status == . restricted || status == . notDetermined){      self. operationQueue. cancelAllOperations()    }  }    func runLocationBlock(callback: @escaping () -&gt; ()) {        //Get the current authorization status    let authState = CLLocationManager. authorizationStatus()        //If we have permissions, start executing the commands immediately    // otherwise request permission    DispatchQueue. main. async {      if(authState == . authorizedAlways || authState == . authorizedWhenInUse) {        self. configureLocationManager()        self. operationQueue. isSuspended = false      }else{        //Request permission        self. locationManager. requestWhenInUseAuthorization()      }    }        //Create a closure with the callback function so we can add it to the operationQueue    let block = {      DispatchQueue. main. async {        callback()      }    }        //Add block to the queue to be executed asynchronously    self. operationQueue. addOperation(block)  }}RunLocationBlock:  We know for one thing that runLocationBlock’s operations is/are set suspended in the ViewController.  We want to know the authorization status first.  If we are authorized, then let’s configure the locationManager second then unsuspend, next, to allow our operationQueue to run all the blocks of operations it cointains.  If we are not authorized, a request will be shown to the user using the app.  The block will contain the callback, which is whatever you put inside the runLocationBlock { }. DidChangeAuthorization:  This is just like what we’ve seen inside runLocationBlock, but we don’t request for authorization again. Instead, when denied/restricted or if the location was not determined, then the operationQueue will not run operations that were added to it.  This is only triggered after self. locationManager. requestWhenInUseAuthorization() that you have seen inside the RunLocationBlock. ConfigureLocationManager:  locationManager. delegate = self this is the most essential part of setting up our locationManager. This allows our ViewController to access protocol methods from CLLocationManagerDelegate like didChangeAuthorization.  If the desiredAccuracy is not set, its default is kCLLocationAccuracyBest for iOS/Mac OS. For watchOS, kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters. This is how you want the location data to be as accurate. It is important to note that higher accuracy will require longer time to retrieve location data.      kCLLocationAccuracyKilometer - within a kilometer   kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers -within 3 kilometers. The higher, the better conservation of energy.    kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation- usually used in navigation apps. Least energy efficient.          locationManager. activityType = . automotiveNavigation     locationManager. distanceFilter = 0          kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters - less energy efficient.     If you use requestLocation(), it will only gather location data once. However, this takes 10 seconds as opposed to startUpdatingLocation(), which fires immediately. "

    "title": "How Static Is Used",
    "body": "2019/10/06 - Static is like creating a global variable. You’ll see what I mean when you’ve watched Sean Allen’s video tutorial. There’s just one hiccup here that might confuse the newbies. Sean used the term Type and the struct’s name interchangeably. Let’s have at it one more time: struct Video {  static let creator =  iOS Junkie     var title: String  var viewCount: Int}let tutorial = Video(title:  Static , viewCount: 1000)The Type mentioned by Sean is the Video struct, which owns the creator. Say you access the creator via Video. creator without creating a Video() object, then it is a type and not an instance like tutorial. tutorial is assigned an instance of Video() object. If you’re curious whether title can be accessed this like this Video. title, then no. Even if it is pre-initialized a value, it will give out an error saying: Instance member 'title' cannot be used on type 'Helper'. You’ll want to use static for a reason like you might not want to create an object to access its properies or methods making it possible to directly access the struct Vlog’s properties without creating an object. Static can also be applied to a method, which allows you to do something like Video. play(). It’s also important to note that you can replace the creator’s value just by assigning it a new value this way: Video. creator =  Sean Allen The next time you access Video. creator or create an object with Video(), the creator will be Sean Allen by then. Now that we’re talking about static, there’s another way to access computed properties and methods of a construct without making an object. This is from Kilo Loco: class Helper {  // Static - allowed in structs and classes  static var staticStoredProperty =  Static Stored Property   static var staticComputedProperty: String {    return  Static computed property   }    static func staticMethod() {    print( Static Method )  }    // Class - only allows within classes, not structs  class var classComputedProperty: String {    return  Class computed property   }    class func classMethod() {    print( class method )  }}class SubHelper : Helper {  override class var classComputedProperty: String {    return  subClassed computed property   }    override class func classMethod() {    print( subclassed method )  }}Aside from static, you can use class in exchange. No! Not the class construct. I’m talking about class type. It works almost similarly to static. However, you cannot store a property like you would with static. With class, you can do something that static too can’t do. You can override computed properties and methods as you can see inside the the SubHelper class. It is important to note that you cannot use the class type inside a struct, only inside classes. These are all valid ways to access properties and methods given the code above: Helper. staticStoredPropertyHelper. staticComputedPropertyHelper. staticMethod()Helper. classComputedPropertyHelper. classMethod()SubHelper. classComputedPropertySubHelper. classMethod()"

If you want a more thorough explanation on this, check out the Swift Language Guide. if john. residence?. printNumberOfRooms() != nil {  print( good )} else {  print( bad )}Both if and guard checks whether the value of a variable could be nil. They are interchangeable depending on the implementation. Let’s start with the code above. This is a primitive way of checking whether a variable/method is or returns nil. It is closer to how guard works than if let. if let firstRoomName = john. residence?[0]. name {  print(firstRoomName)} else {  print( bad.  )}It is important to note here that if let only allows you to acces the new variable firstRoomName inside the first bracket. That is if john. residence?[0]. name optional assigns a non-nil value in our new variable. Outside this if let conditional, firstRoomName cannot be accessed. guard let firstRoomName = john. residence?[0]. name else {  print( bad.  )  return}print(firstRoomName)guard let is just a smart way of making sure a new variable, firstRoomName, will not be accessible anywhere if it is nil. If firstRoomName happens to be assigned a nil value, then “bad” will print and will escape the function where this piece of conditional is located, never allowing to pass firstRoomName to anyone who wants to access its value. The code will not be able to reach the print line anymore. However, if john. residence?[0]. name hold say a string value, then all is good. firstRoomName will now have an unwrapped value of john. residence?[0]. name. "

There’s this pod, made by Fernando himself, that you need to install. pod  MapKitGoogleStyler Wherever you’re using the map view, you need to import this library: import MapKitGoogleStyler.

    "title": "Where To Learn Async Callback and Futures",
    "body": "2019/10/03 - One of my favorite online tutors is Let’s Build That App. He’s really good with his YouTube thing going on. Makes me understand a lot of Swift stuff that I never imagined to be digging into. Most of this article is coming from his tutorial and I’ve also included his video in case anyone’s interested. Async is concurrent. It does not wait for something to finish for it to start working. When you hear async, think low priority, background, and fetching data. That much I know. Fernando Martín Ortiz is another iOS developer who’s talked about this. The callback hell he says. Callback hell looks exactly like our picture above. We must refrain from using callbacks with our async functions to avoid spaghetti like codes. Instead, like Let’s Build That App, use Futures. Whatever the hell that means. Kidding aside, it actually means that it has to return something in the future instead of making a callback. Read more about his thoughts on that here. Now let me dive into Let’s Build That App’s (LBTA) precious little code from his video tutorial. In this video, he shows how to convert a callback async function into a future async function. There’s a lot of code here that’ll overwhelm a newbie. enum NetworkError: Error {  case url  case statusCode  case standard}Let’s start with the simplest tiniest detail that we have to wrap our brains with. If you’re a newbie, you might be intimidated from using enums. I know I do. NetworkError is just a name here and you can change it however you like. It inherits an Error which has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on any custom type you create. Hence, url, statusCode, and standard are just made up by LBTA. You can add more cases of your own words. In the end, these cases will be printed as strings anyway. For example, case url when printed print(NetworkError. url) will return “url”. func fetchSomethingAsyncAwait(url: String) throws -&gt; Data? {  guard let dummyURL = URL(string: url) else {    throw NetworkError. url  }    var data: Data?  var response: URLResponse?  var error: Error?    // Semaphore  let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)		  URLSession. shared. dataTask(with: dummyURL) { (d, r, e) in    data = d    response = r    error = e        semaphore. signal()  }. resume()    // this will return a result, doing this will just get rid of the warning  // but its still functional without assigning it to an underscore  _ = semaphore. wait(timeout: . distantFuture)    if let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpURLResponse. statusCode &gt; 300 {    throw NetworkError. statusCode  }    if error != nil {    throw NetworkError. standard  }    return data}This is a Future. You know when you see one because it needs to return something, Data?. This is a function that can throw an error. So every time you use this function, you must always put it inside a do try catch. do {  let data = try fetchSomethingAsyncAwait(url:  http://google. com )} catch {  print( Failed to Fetch stuff:  , error)  return}If this catches an error, it might print something like “Failed to Fetch stuff: statusCode”. But the most intriguing part of his code is the semaphore. He scheduled the return to execute after the URLSession has finished its task. If there was no semaphore, then the data? might return nil. That’s because he didn’t initialize data when he first created it and it is an optional. With this semaphore superpower, he was able to ask the main thread to wait until a signal() has been found in the distant future. URLSession is the async here, and it is making another thread in the background. Once URLSession’s task reached til the end of its closure, the semaphore. signal() will ask the fetchSomethingAsyncAwait() function to continue where it left off. if let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpURLResponse. statusCode &gt; 300 is the next thing after coming back to the main thread, then the if error != nil. This way, if no error has been thrown, the return data will surely have a value to return, otherwise, it returns nil. To know better about semaphores, check this out. "

    "title": "Where Better To Understand Semaphores (Swift)",
    "body": "2019/10/03 - Thanks to Roy Kronenfeld’s Medium post for this explanation of how to use a semaphore, specifically, utilizing the counter: let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0). Another tutorial was made by Let's Build That App but semaphore wasn’t covered in great detail, and I think it’s best if all iOS developers dive into the semaphore counters the way Roy did. In Roy’s tutorial, it’s more on semaphore counters. But if you want to see semaphore in action, kindly refer to my previous post where it is applied on a Futures function. His sample analogy was most brilliant. If you don’t need to access a shared resource, feel free to use DispatchQueue. If you do, then you should consider Semaphores. The shared resource here is the iPad that 3 kids share. To cut the story short, there is only one iPad and our counter needs a value of only 1.  Only one iPad can be shared among 3 kids at a time. Another example of his is downloading songs. He wants 15 songs to be downloaded and he wants to download 3 songs at a time. Therefore, you’ve guessed it, the counter is set to 3. The shared resource here is the downloading processes or threads, not the song. You can use the semaphore in 2 different ways by Wain from Stackoverflow :  To limit the number of concurrent operations / requests / usages. In this case you start the semaphore at a positive value, like 4. The users each call wait and if resource is available they are allowed to continue. If not they are blocked. When each has finished with the resource they call signal. Just like the two examples given above.  To say when work or a resource is ready and we want to proceed to main thread next. In this case you start the semaphore at 0. The creator calls signal when something is ready. Semaphores can be used when there’s an asynchronous API that you need to make synchronous, but you can’t modify it. The example and explanation below is from Soroush Khanlou:// on a background queuelet semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)doSomeExpensiveWorkAsynchronously(completionBlock: {	semaphore. signal()})semaphore. wait()//the expensive asynchronous work is now done after calling semaphore. wait()Calling . wait() will block the main thread until . signal() is called. This means that . signal() must be called from a different thread, since the current thread is totally blocked. Further, you should never call . wait() from the main thread, only from background threads.

    "body": "2019/10/03 - I’ve seen him talk about how he was hesitant to dive into learning Swift UI. I took his sentiment as my own because I don’t really see why I needed to. Mostly in this video is an ad to designcode. io which is still really a quality content. I only knew about Ray Wenderlich, Treehouse, Coursera, and Udemy in regards to taking courses in relation to Xcode, but this is another one. I don’t know how long it has existed but Meng To, creator of DesignCode, has been updating his courses profoundly like Sean says. I still haven’t seen myself using SwiftUI because I haven’t upgraded to Catalina yet. And without Catalina, my Xcode would not render the canvas beside my code. It would kinda defeat the purpose of me using SwiftUI if I don’t see the changes in my codes. Although that may be the case, I’ve been watching SwiftUI tutorials since because it seems to get a lot better that I initially thought it’d be. Considering Sean’s talk about his dealings in the SwiftUI realm with DesignCode, I’m now interested to see what I could learn and do too, myself. It took him about seven days to finish the course. DesignCode’s course can be billed annually for $108, which will not renew automatically. But if you choose to subscribe for one month, it would cost you $15, which will renew monthly. So for me, it doesn’t look like I’m ready to make that commitment yet of taking his course. Maybe I’ll just look for free lessons out there and it’d be wise if you too. Unless you really want to learn the designs and animations part, you might find his course worth every penny. "

    "title": "Codable JSON Parsing",
    "body": "2019/10/03 - One of the reasons why you should learn this is, first, because you’re an iOS developer. You need to trim down the size of your app by avoiding 3rd party frameworks. Now, let’s look at the code done by Code Pro. let singleDictJSON =      {     foodName :  Banana ,     calories : 100  }   . data(using: . utf8)!class Food: Codable {  let foodName: String  let calories: Int    init( foodName: String, calories: Int ){    self. foodName = foodName    self. calories = calories  }}We are going to decode the json dictionary above. It is in UTF8 for a reason. That is, it allows us to decode it into an object that is an instance of the class Food. Another requirement for us to be able decode or encode is to make the class inherit Codable. Decode is just a fancy way of saying “from json to swift object”. let foodDecoder = JSONDecoder()do {  let foodResult = try foodDecoder. decode(Food. self, from: singleDictJSON)  print(foodResult. foodName)  print(foodResult. calories)} catch {  print( Failed to decode the food: \(error. localizedDescription) )}Provided that singleDictJSON conforms to the Food class then it should not throw an error. However say you removed calories and its value, it will throw an error when decoding it into a Food object. If you stick to that, without a calories in the json, then you’d have to make the calories variable in your class optional, as well as the calories in the initializer. If this is the case, then foodResult. calories will have a value of nil and will not throw an error if the json does not contain calories. let apple = Food(foodName:  Apple , calories: 80)let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()jsonEncoder. outputFormatting = . prettyPrinteddo {  let jsonData = try jsonEncoder. encode(apple)  if let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: . utf8) {    print(jsonString)  }} catch {  print( Failed to decode the food: \(error. localizedDescription) )}What you see is just the reverse of the previous code. It’s pretty simple isn’t it? Encode is just another way of saying “from object to json”. . prettyPrinted is just a writing option that uses white space and indentation to make the output more readable in the console as opposed to a more compact string. If you have no plans on using print on the jsonString, then you don’t have to make it pretty. Here’s a more elaborate code, also taken from Code Pro’s video tutorial. let dogOwnerJSONData =    [  {     name :  Jameson ,     age : 35,     dogs : [      {         dog_name :  Bryce ,         breed :  Pug ,         age : 7      },      {         dog_name :  Furby ,         breed :  Golden Retriever ,         age : 2      }    ]  },  {     name :  Liza ,     age : 30  }]   . data(using: . utf8)!Woah! That’s a bigger structure with a more complex pattern. Here, one of the owners don’t actually own a dog. Not even one. That’s insane! struct Dog: Codable {  let name: String  let breed: String  let age: Int    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {    case name =  dog_name     case breed    case age  }}Woah! That’s even more insane. We’re using CodingKeys now to map to each attributes available for this struct. FYI, structs can also inherit from Codable. Why are we doing the CodingKeys enum? Well, that’s because the dog_name in our json isn’t compliant with the struct’s dog’s name attribute. It will throw an error if we don’t do anything about it. If you’re using CodingKeys, you can’t just map just the one with a different key in the json. Like I said, you have to map to each and every attribute in your struct. struct Owner: Codable {  let name: String  let age: Int  let dogs: [Dog]?}It’s a bit toned down now. Dogs is now just an optional and it will do just fine if the owner doesn’t have a dog. No error will throw. It’s imperative to note that dogs is an array here. let dogOwnerDecoder = JSONDecoder()do {  let dogOwners = try dogOwnerDecoder. decode([Owner]. self, from: dogOwnerJSONData)} catch {  print( Failed to decode the dog owners: \(error. localizedDescription) )}This is familiar, but there’s one tiny difference. We have more than one owner in our json, hence we need an array of Owner like this [Owner]. self. So that’s how you decode an array. "

    "title": "Why I Prefer Cloud Firestore Than Realtime Database",
    "body": "2019/10/02 - This is just a brief insight on why I prefer using Firestore. At first, I was hesitant to dive into Firestore, because I thought there wasn’t really much difference. I saw videos and tutorials of Firestore and it baffled me even more. So, I stayed with Firebase Realtime Database for a little long while, until I started with another Xcode project. I delved into why Firestore might be a better fit. Initially, all I understood was Firebase RD will charge you depending on bandwidth usage, while Firestore will charge on writes and reads. I was intimidated by that. The key is to make the writes and reads as minimal as possible to lessen the cost. In my previous personal project, I used Firebase RD. I have a web app for it and iOS app. Both coded by me. I was wondering why it always took so long to read from Firebase. Then I realized, I created a tree structure and whenever I tried to access the root’s value, it grabs all the branches along with it making my succeeding read queries redundant. It loads a very heavy amount of information as my database grew. That’s how I came to a decision to start using Firestore. Collections. Documents. You must’ve read those before. It’s confusing, I know. That’s how Firestore works. Think of it this way. Collections are Folders, and Documents are files that can contain a pointer to a sub Collection. Documents contain the attributes and its values. Collections only contain Documents. For example:  Customer (Collection)     Jane (Document)         address: “In the woods”           age: 16           Orders (sub Collection)             2019-1-19 (Document)                 item: “Pizza”                                    I hope you see the pattern now. Collections always contain Documents, and Documents can contain Collections. What makes it better than Firebase DB? Well, whenever you reference to collection(“Customer”). document(“Jane”), you won’t be including Orders in your read. Thereby, reducing the load. I guess you can say it’s faster this way. You only get to access the address and age of Jane. If you want to get her orders as well, then reference to collection(“Customer”). document(“Jane”). collection(“Orders”). You can loop through all her orders thereafter. No matter how deep your tree becomes with Firestore, you won’t be able to directly access its sub collections and that cuts down a lot of loading time and heaviness. "

    "body": "2019/10/02 - Notice how Scott changed from @State to @ObjectBinding. He started discussing BindableObject at 5:17. That’s because you can only use @State with local properties in the struct view. Let’s see his code one more time. import Combineclass ListDataSource: BindableObject {	var willChange = PassthroughSubject&lt;Void, Never&gt; ()		var rowModels = [CustomRowModel] () {		willSet {			willChange. send()		}	}}In this tutorial, that’s all the code we need. Just kidding. There’s one more: struct ContentView: View {	@ObjectBinding var datasource = ListDataSource()		// to access the rowModels array	datasource. rowModels}Notice here that he used @ObjectBinding instead of @State. If you want a hold of the state of a class, then you must use @ObjectBinding instead and that class should inherit from BindableObject protocol, which requires that you have a PassthroughSubject. In order to use PassthroughSubject, import Combine first. You can substitude willChange to didChange. Heck, it’s just a variable name. But if you do, also change the willSet to didSet. willChange. send() will notify the subscribed view, which in this case is ContentView, of any changes done to rowModels array. "

    "body": "2019/10/02 - One of the most lovely codes I’ve found is to turn an empty view into something more informative than showing nothing. As you can see, I have two labels in place of my collection view. It’s simple to do, and you’ll be surprised for it. I copied most of the code from Taha Sönmez post on Medium. I believe he explains this in great detail. Although if you’re an intermediate Swift programmer, you might not need the explanation anymore. He did it on a tableview, while this code I’m going to show you is done on a collection view. There’s only 3 lines of code difference. // EmptyView. swiftextension UICollectionView {  func setEmptyView(title: String, message: String) {    let emptyView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: self. center. x, y: self. center. y, width: self. bounds. size. width, height: self. bounds. size. height))    let titleLabel = UILabel()    let messageLabel = UILabel()    titleLabel. translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false    messageLabel. translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false    titleLabel. textColor = UIColor. black    titleLabel. font = UIFont(name:  HelveticaNeue-Bold , size: 18)    messageLabel. textColor = UIColor. lightGray    messageLabel. font = UIFont(name:  HelveticaNeue-Regular , size: 17)    emptyView. addSubview(titleLabel)    emptyView. addSubview(messageLabel)    titleLabel. centerYAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. centerYAnchor). isActive = true    titleLabel. centerXAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. centerXAnchor). isActive = true    messageLabel. topAnchor. constraint(equalTo: titleLabel. bottomAnchor, constant: 20). isActive = true    messageLabel. leftAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. leftAnchor, constant: 20). isActive = true    messageLabel. rightAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. rightAnchor, constant: -20). isActive = true    titleLabel. text = title    messageLabel. text = message    messageLabel. numberOfLines = 0    messageLabel. textAlignment = . center    // The only tricky part is here:    self. backgroundView = emptyView  }  func restore() {    self. backgroundView = nil  }}After extending the UICollectionView, go back to the implementation of your collection view. Add this code in your numberOfItemsInSection: func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {    if orders?. count ?? 0 == 0 {      collectionView. setEmptyView(title:  You don't have any orders yet.  , message:  Your orders will be in here.  )    } else {      collectionView. restore()    }    return orders?. count ?? 0}Restoring is essential here. You wouldn’t want to have the empty view when your collection view reloads and holds data. "

    "title": "Using Cloud Functions To Create Remote Notifications With Firebase In Swift 5 and Javascript",
    "body": "2019/10/01 - This is tested using Firebase Realtime Database, not with Firestore. Before all of these, I assume you have already been using the realtime database. More importantly, you already have the GoogleService-Info. plist in your Xcode project. It is important because it contains your bundle identifier. Without Firebase knowing your bundle identifier, you can’t proceed to enable Cloud messaging. Let’s get this one thing straight. Push notification a. ka. Remote notification. We want to have a Push Notification on our device as a response to a change in the firebase database, and in order to do that, I’m using cloud functions. Cloud functions is a feature of Firebase that allows you to listen to change/s in the firebase database and trigger a response. The response we want is to send a notification. In Firebase’s term, cloud messaging. That’s a confusing term to interchange with remote notification. I know. Install this pod libraries first in addition to your preinstalled libraries with Firebase. pod 'Firebase/Analytics'pod 'Firebase/Core'pod 'Firebase/Messaging'In your Xcode project’s signing and capabilities, enable or add capabilities:  Background Modes -&gt; Remote Notifications Push NotificationsLet’s create a certificate signing request by going to Keychain Access.  On the toolbar, click Keychain Access beside File In this dropdown menu, Certificate Assistant -&gt; Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority Enter your credentials into the text fields and choose Save to disk. Then go to Apple Developer. For this, you need a paid developer account which costs $99.  Open Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles Navigate to Identifiers Click on the current project you are working on.  Beside the Push Notifications, click Configure.  Depending on which environment you are, click Create Certificate Choose a file -&gt; Upload the CertificateSigningRequest. certSigningRequest you just created.  Continue and download aps_development. cer. Once that is done, you will have a . cert file on your desktop. Now let’s convert that to . p12. Still, using the Keychain Access.  File -&gt; Import Items -&gt; Select your . cert file Drag that file to System, assuming you are in login in the Keychains sidebar.  Drag it back from System to login. You now have a duplicate, but you’ll only need the most recent.  Select My Certificates in the Category.  Select the most recent certificate pertaining to your project, and right-click.  Click Export “Apple Development IOS Push Services: your. project…” Make sure to export it in . p12 format.  It will then ask you to create a password to protect this certficate. Give it one and click ok. In order to test this while under development, you need a Provisioning Profile for development to authorize your devices to run an app that is not yet published on the App Store.  Open Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles Select Profiles Generate a Profile Select iOS App Development and continue Select your App ID and continue Select the iOS Development certificate of the App ID you have chosen in the previous step, then click Continue.  Select the iOS devices that you want to include in the Provisioning Profile, then click Continue. Make sure to select all the devices you want to use for your testing.  Name the provisioning profile whatever you want and generate.  Download the provisioning profile and open it to install.  If it crashes your Xcode, just go to your Xcode project settings -&gt; Signing &amp; Capabilities -&gt; Disable Automatically Manage Signing -&gt; Import the provisioning profile. To enable the cloud messaging feature, go to https://console. cloud. google. com/ -&gt; Search for your Firebase project and select it -&gt; APIs and Services -&gt; + ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES-&gt; Search for Firebase Cloud Messaging API -&gt; click Enable. In your Firebase console, navigate to Project Settings -&gt; Cloud Messaging -&gt; iOS app configuration -&gt; APNs Certificates -&gt; Upload the . p12 file here, then enter the password for this certificate. That’s all you need for now to allow Cloud Messaging on your iOS device. It’s like a term for Remote Push Notifications. I was baffled at that at first. Now this is the part where we detect changes in the firebase database. If you haven’t installed the firebase CLI yet, please do so.  Create a directory where you want to put the cloud functions code. In my case, I created triggers directory under my Xcode project directory. Laundry City/triggers ‘cd triggers` In the terminal, type firebase init functions, but make sure you’re logged in with firebase cli.  Choose javascript and type y as in yes to any remaining questions from the cli.  Open index. js and create your function such as below:// index. jsconst functions = require('firebase-functions');const admin = require('firebase-admin');admin. initializeApp();exports. sendNewChangesNotification = functions. database. ref('houses/{house}/items/{item}/'). onWrite((change, context) =&gt; {  var topic =  Serenity ;		  // A message that contains the notification that devices will receive	  var message = {   notification: {    title: 'New Quantity',    body: change. after. val(). product + ' now has ' + change. after. val(). tentative + ' new items. '   }  };  // Using Cloud Messaging to create notification  return admin. messaging(). sendToTopic(topic, message). then(function (response) {    console. log('Successfully sent message:', response);    return null;  }). catch(function (error) {    throw new Error( Error sending message: , error);  });})First thing to note here is, you won’t start your ref with the Project ID. . Instead, the branch below it. The ones in the brackets are ids, which varies. This will detect any write or changes happening in that reference. It will catch the changes in the change parameter. Thereby, allowing access to the new tentative value in change. after. val(). tentative from the reference houses/1/items/2/tentative. 1 and 2 here are just examples of IDs. sendNewChangesNotification is just a variable. You can change it however you like. When everything is in place, go back to terminal and deploy it with firebase deploy. Now, you have a listener or a trigger whenever your items have been changed or added. Your AppDelegate. swift should look like this. This firebase sample is as instructed in the documentation. To send a notification, admin. messaging. send will do the trick. But you have to provide a token, topic, or a condition. Token is generated by the AppDelegate and is uploaded to Firebase automatically. If you specify a specific token, then only the device with that token will receive the notification. Topic is what its name suggests. To subscribe to a topic, add this to wherever you need to put in your Xcode project: Messaging. messaging(). subscribe(toTopic:  Serenity ) { error in     print( Subscribed to weather topic )    }Condition can be something like you want to send this to notification to subscribers of more than one topic. For example:  'Serenity' in topics || 'Manor' in topics . Further documentation about this. "

    "title": "Use Jekyll Manager Instead of Jekyll Admin",
    "body": "2019/09/30 - I was hesitant in making a change at first, since I just started blogging using Jekyll. Looking at how updates are freshly being added to the jekyll-admin library made me think it’s more intuitive. I am wrong. However, the upgrades done in jekyll-manager isn’t really all that drastic. They still haven’t got a fix for when selecting the image metadata. It is still http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/…jpg when I select an image from the static files. I wonder why they haven’t dealt this yet. This should have been the turning point of their fork. Instead, a few UI changes have been made. Some, impressive.  This is my favorite part about jekyll-manager and to be honest, the only thing I care about, really. Directories can be navigated to now, therefore making uploading a hell of a lot easier, now that I’m confident to use this dashboard for uploading images. I no longer have to drag and drop using Finder for this. The metadata too has changed. It is, by default, hidden and expandable. It’s quite confusing why it’s called a FRONT MATTER, instead of metadata. And by default too, layout is the first metadata you’ll be able to see. There’s a select dropdown for the choices for layout. Since in our config. yml, layout is set to post by default, then you can choose to remove this metadata field. tags has this cool feature that allows you to select from previous used tags. However, this feature is still buggy. I found a bug when I try removing a word. It removes the previous word instead of the current word (tag) that needs removing. It’s just sad that it doesn’t work the same with categories. Hence, when typing multiple categories, just separate them with spaces and not a comma. The text editor’s panel for tools is now dark but overall, it works the same and still no Grammarly functionality. I mean Grammarly is disabled when using the text editor, but not on other text fields.  Bummer. For the most part, it looks almost exactly like jekyll-admin and better, but I don’t understand why there isn’t any noticeable changes in jekyll-admin that will make it better than the 2 years ago maintaned code of jekyll-manager. Automating: You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening Automator. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new workflow, then choose to run shell script like so: Type in what you’d normally type on your terminal. cd /Directory/To/Your/Blogsource ~/. bash_profilebundle exec jekyll serve --watchIf you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening localhost:4000/admin on your browser. That’s how you’ll know if it works. And if it does, you may close the Automator and it’ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github. "

    "title": "Custom Table Cell With SwiftUI",
    "body": "2019/09/28 - First of all, thanks to Scott Smith for helping me understand this. I know it can be another learning curve to start learning SwiftUI if you’ve only begun diving into becoming an iOS developer. It’s daunting at first, but I hope it can be simple too for many newbies. Now, I haven’t gotten my hands on Mac OS Catalina yet, so I can’t actually demonstrate my own version of this tutorial properly if I can’t show you the canvas, which isn’t available in Mojave yet, myself. To make a table, add the List() in your ContentView struct ContentView : View {	@State var data = [ Stevens ,  Chloe ,  Frank ]		var body: some View {		List(data, id: \. self) { item in			CustomRow(name: item)		}	}}The id here is what confused me as a beginner. How Scott wrote and explained it is that \. self is meant to give identification automatically to each string from data itself. If you created a more comlex data structure, then you’ll probably just have to specify the id in that structure and assign it a value of UUID(), which returns unique id number.  @State on the other hand is something that will notify if there are any changes in the data array and update whichever component is using that variable. The item represents each item in the data array and it is being passed as an argument to another struct, CustomRow. It’s pretty self explainable what can be done next to create the table cell here. We only have to put in the components we need to complete a single cell in this struct. struct CustomRow : View {	var name: String		var body: some View {		Text(name)	}}If we didn’t need to create a custom table cell, we need not create the CustomRow struct and just use Text(item) instead. In the body of our CustomRow is where you can throw in all the components you’re going to need. So, I thought to myself. That wasn’t daunting at all. You no longer have to specify how many sections and rows, no need to get the cell identifier off from the storyboard, which reduces a hell lot of code to write. It’s just that all UI designs you might have in mind will now have to be written in code which sucks. If you went on with the video tutorial, you might want some answers regarding @ObjectBinding and how it works. Here’s my explanation. "

    "title": "Issues With My First App Store Connect Submission",
    "body": "2019/09/27 - It was my first app submission to the app store. I mean, well, I hadn’t submitted it for review yet, but it already detected a couple of issues that needs dealing with. I uploaded it to app connect for 6 times until I got it right. The first issue I had to deal with only needed a little bit of tweaking in my project’s Signing and Capabilities. From there, I added a Capability known as ‘Push Notifications’. The second one is because of a deprecated API. I tried updating a cocoapod library “Firebase/Auth” after finding out that this utilizes UIWebView. For some reason, I can’t get update working on a single pod. Prior to this, I thought Facebook Core and Facebook Login were the culprits, knowing those would open a UIWebView for me to sign into Facebook. I guess I found a fix on Github issues, which helped other developers with what might have been a similar problem. pod 'FacebookCore', '~&gt; 0. 9. 0'pod 'FacebookLogin', '~&gt; 0. 9. 0'After trying this out, it didn’t actually help with the second issue. Until, I finally decided to update all the pods with just a simple pod updateI didn’t know most of my pods were actually not up-to-date until I did that. Voila, I didn’t get another warning after uploading my project to App Connect. There were just a few more things that needed filling up. Below are things that needed to be filled:    Support URL   It would come as a surprise to you that you actually might need something like this. I mean, it surprised me too. I didn’t fully grasp what it meant even after hovering on the question mark to reveal insights of what this might be. From what I’ve gathered in teamtreehouse. com, “its purpose is to allow users to get in contact with you if they experience problems, desire new features or want to ask questions about your app. ” Hence, I just used my portfolio as the link.     Build   This is an obvious requirement. And just to bring more light into it, because I didn’t know how it worked at first. Every time you make changes in the code or anywhere in your project, you need to change the build number. So, after having dealt with those warning issues above, I had to increase the build number in project settings, otherwise I couldn’t upload a project with an already existing build number in the app connect.     Rating   This I had no idea too. I initially thought why would I be rating stars of my own app? Stupid, right? Well, just click the edit button beside it and you’ll have a change of perspective.   	   Copyright   I’m not running a company, so I also googled what I could possibly put here. I was wondering if I could actually use 2019 iOS Junkie, but maybe not. So, I just used my name instead.     General App Information and Contact Information   I had to fill out all details with fields referring to name, address, contact number, and email address. Otherwise, it will turn red and not submit for review when you have to.  Post submission: I encountered a rejection. Yes, you can’t have all the fun yet. They sent me this email Below it was a screenshot of where in my app particularly went wrong. I changed my Information Property List with just one line of sentence that has to do with my location privacy usage to Laundry City would like to use your current location to display it on the app, also for directions and estimations of distance. It is secure and private. It’s much longer and I hope it’s worth it. "

    "title": "A Free Blog Using Mundana Jekyll Theme In Github Pages",
    "body": "2019/09/27 - This might be too technical for a non computer savvy to be doing, so I’ve formulated this article to help guide you in creating one of your own. If you want your blog to be in a subdirectory just like my blog iosjunkie. com/blog, then you might want to see this first: It really helped me setup a blog as a subdirectory of my domain. I only had to create another repository blog and cloned that repository into my computer. Then I copied Mundana’s contents from Github into the blog folder. Next is you’ll have to setup the config. yml.  If your site is in root, for baseurl, make sure this is set to baseurl: ‘’. In my case it’s baseurl: ‘/blog’. The first few lines of config. yml is straightforward. You’ll have to change those values. Make sure to change the author attributes as well as the default author under defaults. Whenever you post something new, you don’t have to indicate a meta for layout, author and avatar anymore. Now, this is what makes life easier. With this dashboard, you don’t have to explicity input a meta for your title anymore. Although, you might need to put in the categories, permalink, or tags in your metadata field if you wish to add some. It’s not a perfect system, uploading a photo here can be a pain. Which is why I decided to move a photo asset in the /assets/images/ directory manually every time, because it saves the photo in my /blog folder when I upload using jekyll-admin. It’s still a great interface I’m telling you. You can preview your markdown side by side what you’ve written or by toggling preview only. The texteditor isn’t much, but it’ll do more than just using an ordinary one. Install this admin dashboard interface on your Gemfile by adding jekyll-admin to it: group :jekyll_plugins do  gem 'jekyll-feed'  gem 'jekyll-sitemap'  gem 'jekyll-paginate'  gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'  gem 'jekyll-admin'endSave the file and go to terminal/CMD. Type bundle or bundle install to install the gem, but make sure Ruby is installed in your system. You will only be launching this locally. So, everytime you wan to use jekyll-admin, type this on terminal bundle exec jekyll serve --watchthen go to localhost:4000/admin Posting: I catch myself looking at sample posts whenever I create a new post. You might need to if you’re not familiar with the jekyll format or on how to use markdown. So, I renamed the _post folder to post and added post to my . gitignore. It’s not necessary to create another _post folder back, but if you’re not using the jekyll-admin or if you’re just using a text editor, then you should create it again. If you post codes like me, then there’s a bit of an issue with indentation. Every indentation must be done with four spaces, not with 1 or 2 tabs. Creating Pages: Create your pages in _pages, but there’s one very important matter to discuss here. You need a permalink meta for every page you make. Otherwise, the url will become /_pages/your_new_page.  Automating: You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening Automator. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new workflow, then choose to run shell script like so: Type in what you’d normally type on your terminal. cd /Directory/To/Your/Blogsource ~/. bash_profilebundle exec jekyll serve --watchIf you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening localhost:4000/admin on your browser. That’s how you’ll know if it is already done launching the server. And when you’re done writing this script, you may close the Automator and it’ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github. You can then copy it to your Applications folder and it works just like that. You will see that it is running once there a spinning icon in the menu bar. It will say 0% completed for eternity. You cannot close the server even by cancelling the whole process in your menu bar. If you really want to stop the server, go to Activity Monitor and force quite ruby in one of the processes or memory tab. I haven’t figured a workaround on this yet, but it doesn’t seem to bother me.

			<p>I just found one of the best guides to prepare for your interview. I found out about this in Sean Allen’s Swift News. Though I wouldn’t recommended relying on this alone, in case you need to prepare for an interview, because there are other aspects of iOS development that needs perusing.</p>

<p><img src="http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-05%20at%209.26.13%20PM.png" alt="ray wenderlich" /></p>

<p>I don’t always find Ray Wenderlich’s site a great place to look for tutorials. Some of the contents do baffle me sometimes. Although, it’s still a good place to start learning programming, Swift especially. This resource, <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/762435-swift-interview-questions-and-answers">Swift Interview Questions and Answers</a>, is a good find for me though. It’s a good place to start learning or refreshing your knowledge on the most utilized methods of using the Swift language. It’s kind of like a flashcard wherein answers are hidden, then you press the reveal button to get an explanation.</p>

<p>The explanations are superb! It’s not always just a bunch of paragraphs, some have a bunch of examples every step of the way and explained in the simplest-to-understand manner. I mean who needs more explaining when there’s the easy to understand examples. I wish there is a similar resource for <code class="highlighter-rouge">GCD</code> because it is tough for newbies.</p>
