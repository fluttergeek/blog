If you want your blog to be in a subdirectory just like my blog &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;iosjunkie.com/blog&lt;/code&gt;, then you might want to see this first:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nN6QuNqmAwk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It really helped me setup a blog as a subdirectory of my domain. I only had to create another repository &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/code&gt; and cloned that repository into my computer. Then I copied Mundana’s contents from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mundana-theme-jekyll.git&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; into the blog folder. Next is you’ll have to setup the &lt;em&gt;config.yml&lt;/em&gt;.  If your site is in root, for baseurl, make sure this is set to baseurl: ‘’. In my case it’s baseurl: ‘/blog’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first few lines of config.yml is straightforward. You’ll have to change those values. Make sure to change the author attributes as well as the default author under &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;defaults&lt;/code&gt;. Whenever you post something new, you don’t have to indicate a meta for layout, author and avatar anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%206.15.56%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;example&quot; /&gt;
Now, this is what makes life easier. With this dashboard, you don’t have to explicity input a meta for your title anymore. Although, you might need to put in the categories or tags in your metadata field if you wish to add some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%206.29.32%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;metadata&quot; /&gt;
It’s not a perfect system, uploading a photo here can be a pain. Which is why I decided to move a photo asset in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/assets/images/&lt;/code&gt; directory manually every time, because it saves the photo in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;/blog&lt;/code&gt; folder when I upload using &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll-admin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s still a great interface I’m telling you. You can preview your markdown side by side what you’ve written or by toggling preview only. The texteditor isn’t much, but it’ll do more than just using a ordinary one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install this admin dashboard interface on your Gemfile by adding &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll-admin&lt;/code&gt; to it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem 'jekyll-feed'
    gem 'jekyll-sitemap'
    gem 'jekyll-paginate'
    gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'
    gem 'jekyll-admin'
end
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Save the file and go to terminal/CMD. Type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install&lt;/code&gt; to install the gem, but make sure Ruby is installed in your system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will only be launching this locally. So, everytime you wan to use jekyll-admin, type this on terminal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;then go to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;localhost:4000/admin&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;posting&quot;&gt;Posting&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I catch myself looking at sample posts whenever I create a new post. You might need to if you’re not familiar with the jekyll format or on how to use markdown.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jules</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">This might be too technical for a non computer savvy to be doing, so I’ve formulated this article to help guide you in creating one of your own.

I mean, well, I hadn’t submitted it for review yet, but it already detected a couple of issues that needs dealing with. I uploaded it to app connect for 6 times until I got it right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first issue I had to deal with only needed a little bit of tweaking in my project’s ‘Signing and Capabilities’. From there, I added a Capability known as ‘Push Notifications’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second one is because of a deprecated API. I tried updating a cocoapod library “Firebase/Auth” after finding out that this utilizes UIWebView. For some reason, I can’t get update working on a single pod. Prior to this, I thought Facebook Core and Facebook Login were the culprits, knowing those would open a UIWebView for me to sign into Facebook. I guess I found a fix on Github issues, which helped other developers with what might have been a similar problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pod 'FacebookCore', '~&amp;gt; 0.9.0'
pod 'FacebookLogin', '~&amp;gt; 0.9.0'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying this out, it didn’t actually help with the second issue. Until, I finally decided to  update all the pods with just a simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;pod update
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t know most of my pods were actually not up-to-date until I did that. Voila, I didn’t get another warning after uploading my project to App Connect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were just a few more things that needed filling up. Below are things that needed to be filled:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Support URL&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;It would come as a surprise to you that you actually might need something like this. I mean, it surprised me too. I didn’t fully grasp what it meant even after  hovering on the question mark to reveal insights of what this might be. From what I’ve gathered in teamtreehouse.com, “its purpose is to allow users to get in contact with you if they experience problems, desire new features or want to ask questions about your app.” Hence, I just used my portfolio as the link.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Build&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is an obvious requirement. And just to bring more light into it, because I didn’t know how it worked at first. Every time you make changes in the code or anywhere in your project, you need to change the build number. So, after having dealt with those warning issues above, I had to increase the build number in project settings, otherwise I couldn’t upload a project will an already existing build number in the app connect.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rating&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This I had no idea too. I initially thought &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;why would I be rating stars of my own app?&lt;/code&gt; Stupid, right? Well, just click the edit button beside it and you’ll have a change of perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

 	&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%204.09.36%20PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;ratings&quot; /&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Copyright&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I’m not running a company, so I also googled what I could possibly put here. I was wondering if I could actually use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2019 iOS Junkie&lt;/code&gt;, but maybe not. So, I just used my name instead.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;General App Information and Contact Information&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I had to fill out all details with fields referring to name, address, contact number, and email address. Otherwise, it will turn red and not submit for review when you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;post-submission&quot;&gt;Post submission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I encountered a rejection. Yes, you can’t have all the fun yet. They sent me this email&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%2010.45.05%20AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;location&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below it was a screenshot of where in my app particularly went wrong. I changed my Information Property List with just one line of sentence that has to do with my location privacy usage to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Laundry City would like to use your current location to display it on the app, also for directions and estimations of distance. It is secure and private.&lt;/code&gt; It’s much longer and I hope it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>jules</name></author><category term="featured" /><summary type="html">It was my first app submission to the app store.
