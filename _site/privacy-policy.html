First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all. What is Jekyll?: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server. Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free. "

    "body": "Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.  Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson.

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

The Gemfile and Gemfile. lock files inform Bundler about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit bundle exec and just run jekyll serve. When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother. To deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet.

    "body": "There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor. If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here’s a standard YouTube embed code as an example: "

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post. ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: def print_hi(name) puts  Hi, #{name} endprint_hi('Tom')#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.

    "body": "A list of who’s who in the iOS development industry. I know, it sounds a bit much. Please, allow me to fanboy for a bit. This order has no criteria, we don’t want comparing these legends. I mostly found them on YouTube. I may not list the ones who post on Medium, since I have not made any connection with their personalities not that I’ve talked to any of these guys on the list. 1. Brian Voong a. k. a. Let’s Build That App: He makes a lot of tutorials on YouTube and he makes it really simple to understand. He has his website where you can subscribe to his courses, though, I find his courses pricey. 2. Sean Allen: Like Brian, he also creates video tutorials. I was torn between putting him in the first spot but like I said, this isn’t a comparison. His courses are also really well put. He doesn’t sell courses, but he has patreon. That’s where people usually pay him for their suggestions on his next tutorial. He started making Swift News since 2018 which covers a whole lot of perspective on the Swift trend or anything in relation. 3. Meng To a. k. a. DesignCode: He’s like the all around guy teaching designers how to code and developers how to design. He covers React, Flutter and Swift apps. He’s the one Sean reached out to for sponsorship on a particular video about how Sean learned SwiftUI. A lot of his content is more into designing. He uses a lot of tools to teach designers like ProtoPie. 4. Scott Smith: Another great iOS developer tutor. He has only begun to teach SwiftUI since July. His content are superb. 5. Kyle Lee a. k. a. Kilo Loco: The most entertaining coder you’ll see. Head on to his tutorials and you’ll see why. He’s got merch, podcast, membership to his courses and a YouTuber of course, that’s how I found out about him. Heck, that’s how I found out about everyone. Not to mention, he is passionate about coding. 6. CodeWithChris: This one is an O. G. in the game. He’s built a school in this field and you can sign up for one of his courses. They have teacher support and all that good stuff. Not to mention, Chris also has a lot of tutorials on YouTube just like the rest of these guys. "

    "title": "Basic Implementation of Local Notifications",
    "body": "2019/10/08 - Let’s get one thing straight now baby. Local notifications is not the same as Push/Remote notifications. They differ because local notifications don’t need triggers coming from outside the app. Either way, you’ll still need the UNUserNotificationCenter, and for that, you need to import UserNotifications. This is usually used in scheduling apps like alarm and todo-list. // AppDelegate. swiftimport UserNotifications@UIApplicationMainclass AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {  var window: UIWindow?  func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication. LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -&gt; Bool {    // Override point for customization after application launch.         if #available(iOS 10. 0, *) {     // For iOS 10 display notification (sent via APNS)     UNUserNotificationCenter. current(). delegate = self     let authOptions: UNAuthorizationOptions = [. alert, . badge, . sound]     UNUserNotificationCenter. current(). requestAuthorization(      options: authOptions,      completionHandler: {_, _ in })    } else {     let settings: UIUserNotificationSettings =     UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [. alert, . badge, . sound], categories: nil)     application. registerUserNotificationSettings(settings)    }				    return ApplicationDelegate. shared. application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)  }}We must have this in our AppDelegate. swift first. It asks permission from the user if he is okay yo receiving notifications from your app. That request will allow alert, badge, and sound. Depending on how much you want the user to experience the notification. You can omit sound or the other types for example: [. alert, . badge]. Next is the fun part, and you can choose to put it wherever your app needs it. // 1. Preparing our notification contentlet content = UNMutableNotificationContent()content. title =  Hey kid content. body =  Where's your parents? content. sound = UNNotificationSound. default()content. badge = 1// 2. Preparing when our notification would firelet date = Date(). addingTimeInterval(5)let dateComponents = Calendar. current. dateComponents([. year, . month, . day, . hour, . minute, . second], from: date)// 3. Preparing what argument will trigger the notification to come uplet trigger = UNCalendarNotificationTrigger(dateMatching: dateComponents, repeats: false)// 4. Combining all the preparations into one requestlet uuidString = UUID(). uuidStringlet request = UNNotificationRequest(identifier: uuidString, content: content, trigger: trigger)// 5. Finally, execute the requestlet center = UNUserNotificationCenter. current()center. add(request) { (err) in  guard err == nil else { return }  // Whatever you want to do after firing that badass notification}This algorithm is broken down into five parts. :  Create the content. That’s what the user can see in your notification.      The badge is the red circular thing on the top right corner of your app’s icon with the number of how many notifications were fired up.     Setting when to fire up the notification. If you print them out, this is how they’ll look like:      8 Oct 2019 at 2:53 AM  // darw   year: 2019 month: 10 day: 8 hour: 2 minute: 53 second: 26 isLeapMonth: false // dateComponents   You can create your date component this way to be more specific about the date: DateComponents(year: year, month: month, day: day)    Create a trigger and add the when to it. You can make it repeat its time interval by setting repeat to true.  It’s possible that there may be many requests of triggers, hence we needed that id. UUID() is one hell of a one liner that can give you a random string. You can use it anywhere actually. It gives off something like this:  31A7BADF-93F8-40A0-B642-DEDE7BD6179B\n  if you print it.  Finally we may now make the request appear more tangible and we need the current instance of our notification center to allow such a thing to happen. To add buttons on your notification:  Add something like this to step 1: content. categoryIdentifier =  alarm  Add something like this before step 5:  let show = UNNotificationAction(identifier:  show , title:  Tell me more… , options: . foreground)let category = UNNotificationCategory(identifier:  alarm , actions: [show], intentIdentifiers: [])center. setNotificationCategories([category])   And make sure your ViewController conforms to UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate to catch the response coming off from the user’s chosen action on the button. func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {  // pull out the buried userInfo dictionary  let userInfo = response. notification. request. content. userInfo  if let customData = userInfo[ customData ] as? String {    print( Custom data received: \(customData) )    switch response. actionIdentifier {    case UNNotificationDefaultActionIdentifier:      // the user swiped to unlock      print( Default identifier )    case  show :      // the user tapped our  show more info…  button      print( Show more information… )      break    default:      break    }  }  // you must call the completion handler when you're done  completionHandler()}Thanks to CodeWithChris and Paul Hudson @twostraws for making me understand how to actually do this.

    "body": "2019/10/07 - This is the most elegant solution I found on how to retrieve location with CoreLocation. import CoreLocationclass ViewController: UIViewController {    private let locationManager = CLLocationManager()  private let operationQueue = OperationQueue()  override func viewDidLoad() {		super. viewDidLoad()			operationQueue. isSuspended = true		runLocationBlock {			if let location = self. locationManager. location {			}		}} We must create a Location Manager first and foremost.  We created an OperationQueue even though we only have one operation to execute, which is runLocationBlock.  Suspend the operation or pause first to check if we are allowed to request location data.  Whatever is in the runLocationBlock will only run if operationQueue is unsuspended but rest assured this function is already running. extension ViewController: CLLocationManagerDelegate {  private func configureLocationManager() {    locationManager. desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest    locationManager. delegate = self				    // requestLocation will take 10 seconds to run, but only requests location just once    locationManager. requestLocation()				    // startUpdatingLocation will fire up immediately    // locationManager. startUpdatingLocation()  }		  func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError error: Error) {    print( error )  }    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus) {        //If we're authorized to use location services, run all operations in the queue    // otherwise if we were denied access or restricted or location is not determined, cancel the operations				    if(status == . authorizedWhenInUse || status == . authorizedAlways) {      self. operationQueue. isSuspended = false    }else if(status == . denied || status == . restricted || status == . notDetermined){      self. operationQueue. cancelAllOperations()    }  }    func runLocationBlock(callback: @escaping () -&gt; ()) {        //Get the current authorization status    let authState = CLLocationManager. authorizationStatus()        //If we have permissions, start executing the commands immediately    // otherwise request permission    DispatchQueue. main. async {      if(authState == . authorizedAlways || authState == . authorizedWhenInUse) {        self. configureLocationManager()        self. operationQueue. isSuspended = false      }else{        //Request permission        self. locationManager. requestWhenInUseAuthorization()      }    }        //Create a closure with the callback function so we can add it to the operationQueue    let block = {      DispatchQueue. main. async {        callback()      }    }        //Add block to the queue to be executed asynchronously    self. operationQueue. addOperation(block)  }}RunLocationBlock:  We know for one thing that runLocationBlock’s operations is/are set suspended in the ViewController.  We want to know the authorization status first.  If we are authorized, then let’s configure the locationManager second then unsuspend, next, to allow our operationQueue to run all the blocks of operations it cointains.  If we are not authorized, a request will be shown to the user using the app.  The block will contain the callback, which is whatever you put inside the runLocationBlock { }. DidChangeAuthorization:  This is just like what we’ve seen inside runLocationBlock, but we don’t request for authorization again. Instead, when denied/restricted or if the location was not determined, then the operationQueue will not run operations that were added to it.  This is only triggered after self. locationManager. requestWhenInUseAuthorization() that you have seen inside the RunLocationBlock. ConfigureLocationManager:  locationManager. delegate = self this is the most essential part of setting up our locationManager. This allows our ViewController to access protocol methods from CLLocationManagerDelegate like didChangeAuthorization.  If the desiredAccuracy is not set, its default is kCLLocationAccuracyBest for iOS/Mac OS. For watchOS, kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters. This is how you want the location data to be as accurate. It is important to note that higher accuracy will require longer time to retrieve location data.      kCLLocationAccuracyKilometer - within a kilometer   kCLLocationAccuracyThreeKilometers -within 3 kilometers. The higher, the better conservation of energy.    kCLLocationAccuracyBestForNavigation- usually used in navigation apps. Least energy efficient.          locationManager. activityType = . automotiveNavigation     locationManager. distanceFilter = 0          kCLLocationAccuracyNearestTenMeters - less energy efficient.     If you use requestLocation(), it will only gather location data once. However, this takes 10 seconds as opposed to startUpdatingLocation(), which fires immediately. "

GCD is an API provided by apple to allow you to manage concurrent operations in a smooth way, in order to avoid freezing of your application and keep it always responsive for users. - Jaafar Barek Swift Multi-Threading using GCD For Beginners. This is just a brief article with great visual aids to simply start off learning DispatchQueue. When you’re done with that, hold your breath and dive in two of these lakes. Asynchronous Multi-Threaded Parallel World of Swift and Ultimate Grand Central Dispatch tutorial in Swift. The former will first walk you through processing concepts and many visuals on how to use DispatchQueue, Semaphores, and SwiftUI’s combine in relation to asynchronous operations. The latter is almost the same but with less visuals and no combine. DispatchWorkItem and deadlocks is discussed which isn’t found in the former. Both are really valuable resources for learning GCD. It takes quite a while to grasp this simple concept but with broad applications, so I recommend reading on both to consolidate that chunk of knowledge. It is really intimidating to learn, since most of the time, programmers only usually use background and main. I bet these resources are good for interviews too. "

    "title": "How Static Is Used",
    "body": "2019/10/06 - Static is like creating a global variable. You’ll see what I mean when you’ve watched Sean Allen’s video tutorial. There’s just one hiccup here that might confuse the newbies. Sean used the term Type and the struct’s name interchangeably. Let’s have at it one more time: struct Video {  static let creator =  iOS Junkie     var title: String  var viewCount: Int}let tutorial = Video(title:  Static , viewCount: 1000)The Type mentioned by Sean is the Video struct, which owns the creator. Say you access the creator via Video. creator without creating a Video() object, then it is a type and not an instance like tutorial. tutorial is assigned an instance of Video() object. If you’re curious whether title can be accessed this like this Video. title, then no. Even if it is pre-initialized a value, it will give out an error saying: Instance member 'title' cannot be used on type 'Helper'. You’ll want to use static for a reason like you might not want to create an object to access its properies or methods making it possible to directly access the struct Vlog’s properties without creating an object. Static can also be applied to a method, which allows you to do something like Video. play(). It’s also important to note that you can replace the creator’s value just by assigning it a new value this way: Video. creator =  Sean Allen The next time you access Video. creator or create an object with Video(), the creator will be Sean Allen by then. Now that we’re talking about static, there’s another way to access computed properties and methods of a construct without making an object. This is from Kilo Loco: class Helper {  // Static - allowed in structs and classes  static var staticStoredProperty =  Static Stored Property   static var staticComputedProperty: String {    return  Static computed property   }    static func staticMethod() {    print( Static Method )  }    // Class - only allows within classes, not structs  class var classComputedProperty: String {    return  Class computed property   }    class func classMethod() {    print( class method )  }}class SubHelper : Helper {  override class var classComputedProperty: String {    return  subClassed computed property   }    override class func classMethod() {    print( subclassed method )  }}Aside from static, you can use class in exchange. No! Not the class construct. I’m talking about class type. It works almost similarly to static. However, you cannot store a property like you would with static. With class, you can do something that static too can’t do. You can override computed properties and methods as you can see inside the the SubHelper class. It is important to note that you cannot use the class type inside a struct, only inside classes. These are all valid ways to access properties and methods given the code above: Helper. staticStoredPropertyHelper. staticComputedPropertyHelper. staticMethod()Helper. classComputedPropertyHelper. classMethod()SubHelper. classComputedPropertySubHelper. classMethod()"

I don’t always find Ray Wenderlich’s site a great place to look for tutorials. Some of the contents do baffle me sometimes.

It’s a good place to start learning or refreshing your knowledge on the most utilized methods of using the Swift language. It’s kind of like a flashcard wherein answers are hidden, then you press the reveal button to get an explanation. The explanations are superb! It’s not always just a bunch of paragraphs, some have a bunch of examples every step of the way and explained in the simplest-to-understand manner.

I never touched them at all. If you want a more thorough explanation on this, check out the Swift Language Guide. if john. residence?. printNumberOfRooms() != nil {  print( good )} else {  print( bad )}Both if and guard checks whether the value of a variable could be nil. They are interchangeable depending on the implementation. Let’s start with the code above. This is a primitive way of checking whether a variable/method is or returns nil. It is closer to how guard works than if let. if let firstRoomName = john. residence?[0]. name {  print(firstRoomName)} else {  print( bad.  )}It is important to note here that if let only allows you to acces the new variable firstRoomName inside the first bracket. That is if john. residence?[0]. name optional assigns a non-nil value in our new variable. Outside this if let conditional, firstRoomName cannot be accessed. guard let firstRoomName = john. residence?[0]. name else {  print( bad.  )  return}print(firstRoomName)guard let is just a smart way of making sure a new variable, firstRoomName, will not be accessible anywhere if it is nil. If firstRoomName happens to be assigned a nil value, then “bad” will print and will escape the function where this piece of conditional is located, never allowing to pass firstRoomName to anyone who wants to access its value. The code will not be able to reach the print line anymore. However, if john. residence?[0]. name hold say a string value, then all is good. firstRoomName will now have an unwrapped value of john. residence?[0]. name. "

It’s now an outdated solution, but I found a way for it to work. Thanks to Fernando Martín Ortiz for that post. There’s this pod, made by Fernando himself, that you need to install. pod  MapKitGoogleStyler Wherever you’re using the map view, you need to import this library: import MapKitGoogleStyler.

Otherwise, your json will not be found by Bundle. main. path(forResource:  overlay , ofType:  json ) .  You may be wondering, where do I get such theme? Did I make those myself? No, silly!

It’s the location where Xcode stores all kinds of intermediate build results, generated indexes, etc. DerivedData folder is also infamous for growing up to gargantuan sizes. My latest project alone built up 6. 33 GB of derived data after I saw my Xcode index and ran build with this project. Horrible! Because my project folder’s contents is only way less than half of that. 2 GB to be exact.

    "title": "Where To Learn Async Callback and Futures",
    "body": "2019/10/03 - One of my favorite online tutors is Let’s Build That App. He’s really good with his YouTube thing going on. Makes me understand a lot of Swift stuff that I never imagined to be digging into. Most of this article is coming from his tutorial and I’ve also included his video in case anyone’s interested. Async is concurrent. It does not wait for something to finish for it to start working. When you hear async, think low priority, background, and fetching data. That much I know. Fernando Martín Ortiz is another iOS developer who’s talked about this. The callback hell he says. Callback hell looks exactly like our picture above. We must refrain from using callbacks with our async functions to avoid spaghetti like codes. Instead, like Let’s Build That App, use Futures. Whatever the hell that means. Kidding aside, it actually means that it has to return something in the future instead of making a callback. Read more about his thoughts on that here. Now let me dive into Let’s Build That App’s (LBTA) precious little code from his video tutorial. In this video, he shows how to convert a callback async function into a future async function. There’s a lot of code here that’ll overwhelm a newbie. enum NetworkError: Error {  case url  case statusCode  case standard}Let’s start with the simplest tiniest detail that we have to wrap our brains with. If you’re a newbie, you might be intimidated from using enums. I know I do. NetworkError is just a name here and you can change it however you like. It inherits an Error which has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on any custom type you create. Hence, url, statusCode, and standard are just made up by LBTA. You can add more cases of your own words. In the end, these cases will be printed as strings anyway. For example, case url when printed print(NetworkError. url) will return “url”. func fetchSomethingAsyncAwait(url: String) throws -&gt; Data? {  guard let dummyURL = URL(string: url) else {    throw NetworkError. url  }    var data: Data?  var response: URLResponse?  var error: Error?    // Semaphore  let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)		  URLSession. shared. dataTask(with: dummyURL) { (d, r, e) in    data = d    response = r    error = e        semaphore. signal()  }. resume()    // this will return a result, doing this will just get rid of the warning  // but its still functional without assigning it to an underscore  _ = semaphore. wait(timeout: . distantFuture)    if let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpURLResponse. statusCode &gt; 300 {    throw NetworkError. statusCode  }    if error != nil {    throw NetworkError. standard  }    return data}This is a Future. You know when you see one because it needs to return something, Data?. This is a function that can throw an error. So every time you use this function, you must always put it inside a do try catch. do {  let data = try fetchSomethingAsyncAwait(url:  http://google. com )} catch {  print( Failed to Fetch stuff:  , error)  return}If this catches an error, it might print something like “Failed to Fetch stuff: statusCode”. But the most intriguing part of his code is the semaphore. He scheduled the return to execute after the URLSession has finished its task. If there was no semaphore, then the data? might return nil. That’s because he didn’t initialize data when he first created it and it is an optional. With this semaphore superpower, he was able to ask the main thread to wait until a signal() has been found in the distant future. URLSession is the async here, and it is making another thread in the background. Once URLSession’s task reached til the end of its closure, the semaphore. signal() will ask the fetchSomethingAsyncAwait() function to continue where it left off. if let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpURLResponse. statusCode &gt; 300 is the next thing after coming back to the main thread, then the if error != nil. This way, if no error has been thrown, the return data will surely have a value to return, otherwise, it returns nil. To know better about semaphores, check this out. "

    "body": "2019/10/03 - Thanks to Roy Kronenfeld’s Medium post for this explanation of how to use a semaphore, specifically, utilizing the counter: let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0). Another tutorial was made by Let's Build That App but semaphore wasn’t covered in great detail, and I think it’s best if all iOS developers dive into the semaphore counters the way Roy did. In Roy’s tutorial, it’s more on semaphore counters. But if you want to see semaphore in action, kindly refer to my previous post where it is applied on a Futures function. His sample analogy was most brilliant. If you don’t need to access a shared resource, feel free to use DispatchQueue. If you do, then you should consider Semaphores. The shared resource here is the iPad that 3 kids share. To cut the story short, there is only one iPad and our counter needs a value of only 1.  Only one iPad can be shared among 3 kids at a time. Another example of his is downloading songs. He wants 15 songs to be downloaded and he wants to download 3 songs at a time. Therefore, you’ve guessed it, the counter is set to 3. The shared resource here is the downloading processes or threads, not the song. If you want a more elaborate explanation on how this counting algorithm works, head on to his blog post for more. "

Mostly in this video is an ad to designcode. io which is still really a quality content. I only knew about Ray Wenderlich, Treehouse, Coursera, and Udemy in regards to taking courses in relation to Xcode, but this is another one. I don’t know how long it has existed but Meng To, creator of DesignCode, has been updating his courses profoundly like Sean says. I still haven’t seen myself using SwiftUI because I haven’t upgraded to Catalina yet. And without Catalina, my Xcode would not render the canvas beside my code. It would kinda defeat the purpose of me using SwiftUI if I don’t see the changes in my codes. Although that may be the case, I’ve been watching SwiftUI tutorials since because it seems to get a lot better that I initially thought it’d be. Considering Sean’s talk about his dealings in the SwiftUI realm with DesignCode, I’m now interested to see what I could learn and do too, myself. It took him about seven days to finish the course. DesignCode’s course can be billed annually for $108, which will not renew automatically. But if you choose to subscribe for one month, it would cost you $15, which will renew monthly. So for me, it doesn’t look like I’m ready to make that commitment yet of taking his course. Maybe I’ll just look for free lessons out there and it’d be wise if you too. Unless you really want to learn the designs and animations part, you might find his course worth every penny. "

    "title": "Codable JSON Parsing",
    "body": "2019/10/03 - One of the reasons why you should learn this is, first, because you’re an iOS developer. You need to trim down the size of your app by avoiding 3rd party frameworks. Now, let’s look at the code done by Code Pro. let singleDictJSON =      {     foodName :  Banana ,     calories : 100  }   . data(using: . utf8)!class Food: Codable {  let foodName: String  let calories: Int    init( foodName: String, calories: Int ){    self. foodName = foodName    self. calories = calories  }}We are going to decode the json dictionary above. It is in UTF8 for a reason. That is, it allows us to decode it into an object that is an instance of the class Food. Another requirement for us to be able decode or encode is to make the class inherit Codable. Decode is just a fancy way of saying “from json to swift object”. let foodDecoder = JSONDecoder()do {  let foodResult = try foodDecoder. decode(Food. self, from: singleDictJSON)  print(foodResult. foodName)  print(foodResult. calories)} catch {  print( Failed to decode the food: \(error. localizedDescription) )}Provided that singleDictJSON conforms to the Food class then it should not throw an error. However say you removed calories and its value, it will throw an error when decoding it into a Food object. If you stick to that, without a calories in the json, then you’d have to make the calories variable in your class optional, as well as the calories in the initializer. If this is the case, then foodResult. calories will have a value of nil and will not throw an error if the json does not contain calories. let apple = Food(foodName:  Apple , calories: 80)let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()jsonEncoder. outputFormatting = . prettyPrinteddo {  let jsonData = try jsonEncoder. encode(apple)  if let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: . utf8) {    print(jsonString)  }} catch {  print( Failed to decode the food: \(error. localizedDescription) )}What you see is just the reverse of the previous code. It’s pretty simple isn’t it? Encode is just another way of saying “from object to json”. . prettyPrinted is just a writing option that uses white space and indentation to make the output more readable in the console as opposed to a more compact string. If you have no plans on using print on the jsonString, then you don’t have to make it pretty. Here’s a more elaborate code, also taken from Code Pro’s video tutorial. let dogOwnerJSONData =    [  {     name :  Jameson ,     age : 35,     dogs : [      {         dog_name :  Bryce ,         breed :  Pug ,         age : 7      },      {         dog_name :  Furby ,         breed :  Golden Retriever ,         age : 2      }    ]  },  {     name :  Liza ,     age : 30  }]   . data(using: . utf8)!Woah! That’s a bigger structure with a more complex pattern. Here, one of the owners don’t actually own a dog. Not even one. That’s insane! struct Dog: Codable {  let name: String  let breed: String  let age: Int    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {    case name =  dog_name     case breed    case age  }}Woah! That’s even more insane. We’re using CodingKeys now to map to each attributes available for this struct. FYI, structs can also inherit from Codable. Why are we doing the CodingKeys enum? Well, that’s because the dog_name in our json isn’t compliant with the struct’s dog’s name attribute. It will throw an error if we don’t do anything about it. If you’re using CodingKeys, you can’t just map just the one with a different key in the json. Like I said, you have to map to each and every attribute in your struct. struct Owner: Codable {  let name: String  let age: Int  let dogs: [Dog]?}It’s a bit toned down now. Dogs is now just an optional and it will do just fine if the owner doesn’t have a dog. No error will throw. It’s imperative to note that dogs is an array here. let dogOwnerDecoder = JSONDecoder()do {  let dogOwners = try dogOwnerDecoder. decode([Owner]. self, from: dogOwnerJSONData)} catch {  print( Failed to decode the dog owners: \(error. localizedDescription) )}This is familiar, but there’s one tiny difference. We have more than one owner in our json, hence we need an array of Owner like this [Owner]. self. So that’s how you decode an array. "

    "title": "Why I Prefer Cloud Firestore Than Realtime Database",
    "body": "2019/10/02 - This is just a brief insight on why I prefer using Firestore. At first, I was hesitant to dive into Firestore, because I thought there wasn’t really much difference. I saw videos and tutorials of Firestore and it baffled me even more. So, I stayed with Firebase Realtime Database for a little long while, until I started with another Xcode project. I delved into why Firestore might be a better fit. Initially, all I understood was Firebase RD will charge you depending on bandwidth usage, while Firestore will charge on writes and reads. I was intimidated by that. The key is to make the writes and reads as minimal as possible to lessen the cost. In my previous personal project, I used Firebase RD. I have a web app for it and iOS app. Both coded by me. I was wondering why it always took so long to read from Firebase. Then I realized, I created a tree structure and whenever I tried to access the root’s value, it grabs all the branches along with it making my succeeding read queries redundant. It loads a very heavy amount of information as my database grew. That’s how I came to a decision to start using Firestore. Collections. Documents. You must’ve read those before. It’s confusing, I know. That’s how Firestore works. Think of it this way. Collections are Folders, and Documents are files that can contain a pointer to a sub Collection. Documents contain the attributes and its values. Collections only contain Documents. For example:  Customer (Collection)     Jane (Document)         address: “In the woods”           age: 16           Orders (sub Collection)             2019-1-19 (Document)                 item: “Pizza”                                    I hope you see the pattern now. Collections always contain Documents, and Documents can contain Collections. What makes it better than Firebase DB? Well, whenever you reference to collection(“Customer”). document(“Jane”), you won’t be including Orders in your read. Thereby, reducing the load. I guess you can say it’s faster this way. You only get to access the address and age of Jane. If you want to get her orders as well, then reference to collection(“Customer”). document(“Jane”). collection(“Orders”). You can loop through all her orders thereafter. No matter how deep your tree becomes with Firestore, you won’t be able to directly access its sub collections and that cuts down a lot of loading time and heaviness. "

There’s only 3 lines of code difference. // EmptyView. swiftextension UICollectionView {  func setEmptyView(title: String, message: String) {    let emptyView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: self. center. x, y: self. center. y, width: self. bounds. size. width, height: self. bounds. size. height))    let titleLabel = UILabel()    let messageLabel = UILabel()    titleLabel. translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false    messageLabel. translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false    titleLabel. textColor = UIColor. black    titleLabel. font = UIFont(name:  HelveticaNeue-Bold , size: 18)    messageLabel. textColor = UIColor. lightGray    messageLabel. font = UIFont(name:  HelveticaNeue-Regular , size: 17)    emptyView. addSubview(titleLabel)    emptyView. addSubview(messageLabel)    titleLabel. centerYAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. centerYAnchor). isActive = true    titleLabel. centerXAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. centerXAnchor). isActive = true    messageLabel. topAnchor. constraint(equalTo: titleLabel. bottomAnchor, constant: 20). isActive = true    messageLabel. leftAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. leftAnchor, constant: 20). isActive = true    messageLabel. rightAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. rightAnchor, constant: -20). isActive = true    titleLabel. text = title    messageLabel. text = message    messageLabel. numberOfLines = 0    messageLabel. textAlignment = . center    // The only tricky part is here:    self. backgroundView = emptyView  }  func restore() {    self. backgroundView = nil  }}After extending the UICollectionView, go back to the implementation of your collection view. Add this code in your numberOfItemsInSection: func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {    if orders?. count ?? 0 == 0 {      collectionView. setEmptyView(title:  You don't have any orders yet.  , message:  Your orders will be in here.  )    } else {      collectionView. restore()    }    return orders?. count ?? 0}Restoring is essential here. You wouldn’t want to have the empty view when your collection view reloads and holds data. "

    "title": "Using Cloud Functions To Create Remote Notifications With Firebase In Swift 5 and Javascript",
    "body": "2019/10/01 - This is tested using Firebase Realtime Database, not with Firestore. Before all of these, I assume you have already been using the realtime database. More importantly, you already have the GoogleService-Info. plist in your Xcode project. It is important because it contains your bundle identifier. Without Firebase knowing your bundle identifier, you can’t proceed to enable Cloud messaging. Let’s get this one thing straight. Push notification a. ka. Remote notification. We want to have a Push Notification on our device as a response to a change in the firebase database, and in order to do that, I’m using cloud functions. Cloud functions is a feature of Firebase that allows you to listen to change/s in the firebase database and trigger a response. The response we want is to send a notification. In Firebase’s term, cloud messaging. That’s a confusing term to interchange with remote notification. I know. Install this pod libraries first in addition to your preinstalled libraries with Firebase. pod 'Firebase/Analytics'pod 'Firebase/Core'pod 'Firebase/Messaging'In your Xcode project’s signing and capabilities, enable or add capabilities:  Background Modes -&gt; Remote Notifications Push NotificationsLet’s create a certificate signing request by going to Keychain Access.  On the toolbar, click Keychain Access beside File In this dropdown menu, Certificate Assistant -&gt; Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority Enter your credentials into the text fields and choose Save to disk. Then go to Apple Developer. For this, you need a paid developer account which costs $99.  Open Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles Navigate to Identifiers Click on the current project you are working on.  Beside the Push Notifications, click Configure.  Depending on which environment you are, click Create Certificate Choose a file -&gt; Upload the CertificateSigningRequest. certSigningRequest you just created.  Continue and download aps_development. cer. Once that is done, you will have a . cert file on your desktop. Now let’s convert that to . p12. Still, using the Keychain Access.  File -&gt; Import Items -&gt; Select your . cert file Drag that file to System, assuming you are in login in the Keychains sidebar.  Drag it back from System to login. You now have a duplicate, but you’ll only need the most recent.  Select My Certificates in the Category.  Select the most recent certificate pertaining to your project, and right-click.  Click Export “Apple Development IOS Push Services: your. project…” Make sure to export it in . p12 format.  It will then ask you to create a password to protect this certficate. Give it one and click ok. In order to test this while under development, you need a Provisioning Profile for development to authorize your devices to run an app that is not yet published on the App Store.  Open Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles Select Profiles Generate a Profile Select iOS App Development and continue Select your App ID and continue Select the iOS Development certificate of the App ID you have chosen in the previous step, then click Continue.  Select the iOS devices that you want to include in the Provisioning Profile, then click Continue. Make sure to select all the devices you want to use for your testing.  Name the provisioning profile whatever you want and generate.  Download the provisioning profile and open it to install.  If it crashes your Xcode, just go to your Xcode project settings -&gt; Signing &amp; Capabilities -&gt; Disable Automatically Manage Signing -&gt; Import the provisioning profile. To enable the cloud messaging feature, go to https://console. cloud. google. com/ -&gt; Search for your Firebase project and select it -&gt; APIs and Services -&gt; + ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES-&gt; Search for Firebase Cloud Messaging API -&gt; click Enable. In your Firebase console, navigate to Project Settings -&gt; Cloud Messaging -&gt; iOS app configuration -&gt; APNs Certificates -&gt; Upload the . p12 file here, then enter the password for this certificate. That’s all you need for now to allow Cloud Messaging on your iOS device. It’s like a term for Remote Push Notifications. I was baffled at that at first. Now this is the part where we detect changes in the firebase database. If you haven’t installed the firebase CLI yet, please do so.  Create a directory where you want to put the cloud functions code. In my case, I created triggers directory under my Xcode project directory. Laundry City/triggers ‘cd triggers` In the terminal, type firebase init functions, but make sure you’re logged in with firebase cli.  Choose javascript and type y as in yes to any remaining questions from the cli.  Open index. js and create your function such as below:// index. jsconst functions = require('firebase-functions');const admin = require('firebase-admin');admin. initializeApp();exports. sendNewChangesNotification = functions. database. ref('houses/{house}/items/{item}/'). onWrite((change, context) =&gt; {  var topic =  Serenity ;		  // A message that contains the notification that devices will receive	  var message = {   notification: {    title: 'New Quantity',    body: change. after. val(). product + ' now has ' + change. after. val(). tentative + ' new items. '   }  };  // Using Cloud Messaging to create notification  return admin. messaging(). sendToTopic(topic, message). then(function (response) {    console. log('Successfully sent message:', response);    return null;  }). catch(function (error) {    throw new Error( Error sending message: , error);  });})First thing to note here is, you won’t start your ref with the Project ID. . Instead, the branch below it. The ones in the brackets are ids, which varies. This will detect any write or changes happening in that reference. It will catch the changes in the change parameter. Thereby, allowing access to the new tentative value in change. after. val(). tentative from the reference houses/1/items/2/tentative. 1 and 2 here are just examples of IDs. sendNewChangesNotification is just a variable. You can change it however you like. When everything is in place, go back to terminal and deploy it with firebase deploy. Now, you have a listener or a trigger whenever your items have been changed or added. Your AppDelegate. swift should look like this. This firebase sample is as instructed in the documentation. To send a notification, admin. messaging. send will do the trick. But you have to provide a token, topic, or a condition. Token is generated by the AppDelegate and is uploaded to Firebase automatically. If you specify a specific token, then only the device with that token will receive the notification. Topic is what its name suggests. To subscribe to a topic, add this to wherever you need to put in your Xcode project: Messaging. messaging(). subscribe(toTopic:  Serenity ) { error in     print( Subscribed to weather topic )    }Condition can be something like you want to send this to notification to subscribers of more than one topic. For example:  'Serenity' in topics || 'Manor' in topics . Further documentation about this. "

    "title": "Use Jekyll Manager Instead of Jekyll Admin",
    "body": "2019/09/30 - I was hesitant in making a change at first, since I just started blogging using Jekyll. Looking at how updates are freshly being added to the jekyll-admin library made me think it’s more intuitive. I am wrong. However, the upgrades done in jekyll-manager isn’t really all that drastic. They still haven’t got a fix for when selecting the image metadata. It is still http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/…jpg when I select an image from the static files. I wonder why they haven’t dealt this yet. This should have been the turning point of their fork. Instead, a few UI changes have been made. Some, impressive.  This is my favorite part about jekyll-manager and to be honest, the only thing I care about, really. Directories can be navigated to now, therefore making uploading a hell of a lot easier, now that I’m confident to use this dashboard for uploading images. I no longer have to drag and drop using Finder for this. The metadata too has changed. It is, by default, hidden and expandable. It’s quite confusing why it’s called a FRONT MATTER, instead of metadata. And by default too, layout is the first metadata you’ll be able to see. There’s a select dropdown for the choices for layout. Since in our config. yml, layout is set to post by default, then you can choose to remove this metadata field. tags has this cool feature that allows you to select from previous used tags. However, this feature is still buggy. I found a bug when I try removing a word. It removes the previous word instead of the current word (tag) that needs removing. It’s just sad that it doesn’t work the same with categories. Hence, when typing multiple categories, just separate them with spaces and not a comma. The text editor’s panel for tools is now dark but overall, it works the same and still no Grammarly functionality. I mean Grammarly is disabled when using the text editor, but not on other text fields.  Bummer. For the most part, it looks almost exactly like jekyll-admin and better, but I don’t understand why there isn’t any noticeable changes in jekyll-admin that will make it better than the 2 years ago maintaned code of jekyll-manager. Automating: You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening Automator. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new workflow, then choose to run shell script like so: Type in what you’d normally type on your terminal. cd /Directory/To/Your/Blogsource ~/. bash_profilebundle exec jekyll serve --watchIf you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening localhost:4000/admin on your browser. That’s how you’ll know if it works. And if it does, you may close the Automator and it’ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github. "

    "title": "Custom Table Cell With SwiftUI",
    "body": "2019/09/28 - First of all, thanks to Scott Smith for helping me understand this. I know it can be another learning curve to start learning SwiftUI if you’ve only begun diving into becoming an iOS developer. It’s daunting at first, but I hope it can be simple too for many newbies. Now, I haven’t gotten my hands on Mac OS Catalina yet, so I can’t actually demonstrate my own version of this tutorial properly if I can’t show you the canvas, which isn’t available in Mojave yet, myself. To make a table, add the List() in your ContentView struct ContentView : View {	@State var data = [ Stevens ,  Chloe ,  Frank ]		var body: some View {		List(data, id: \. self) { item in			CustomRow(name: item)		}	}}The id here is what confused me as a beginner. How Scott wrote and explained it is that \. self is meant to give identification automatically to each string from data itself. If you created a more comlex data structure, then you’ll probably just have to specify the id in that structure and assign it a value of UUID(), which returns unique id number.  @State on the other hand is something that will notify if there are any changes in the data array and update whichever component is using that variable. The item represents each item in the data array and it is being passed as an argument to another struct, CustomRow. It’s pretty self explainable what can be done next to create the table cell here. We only have to put in the components we need to complete a single cell in this struct. struct CustomRow : View {	var name: String		var body: some View {		Text(name)	}}If we didn’t need to create a custom table cell, we need not create the CustomRow struct and just use Text(item) instead. In the body of our CustomRow is where you can throw in all the components you’re going to need. So, I thought to myself. That wasn’t daunting at all. You no longer have to specify how many sections and rows, no need to get the cell identifier off from the storyboard, which reduces a hell lot of code to write. It’s just that all UI designs you might have in mind will now have to be written in code which sucks. If you went on with the video tutorial, you might want some answers regarding @ObjectBinding and how it works. Here’s my explanation. "

    "body": "2019/09/27 - It was my first app submission to the app store. I mean, well, I hadn’t submitted it for review yet, but it already detected a couple of issues that needs dealing with. I uploaded it to app connect for 6 times until I got it right. The first issue I had to deal with only needed a little bit of tweaking in my project’s Signing and Capabilities. From there, I added a Capability known as ‘Push Notifications’. The second one is because of a deprecated API. I tried updating a cocoapod library “Firebase/Auth” after finding out that this utilizes UIWebView. For some reason, I can’t get update working on a single pod. Prior to this, I thought Facebook Core and Facebook Login were the culprits, knowing those would open a UIWebView for me to sign into Facebook. I guess I found a fix on Github issues, which helped other developers with what might have been a similar problem. pod 'FacebookCore', '~&gt; 0. 9. 0'pod 'FacebookLogin', '~&gt; 0. 9. 0'After trying this out, it didn’t actually help with the second issue. Until, I finally decided to update all the pods with just a simple pod updateI didn’t know most of my pods were actually not up-to-date until I did that. Voila, I didn’t get another warning after uploading my project to App Connect. There were just a few more things that needed filling up. Below are things that needed to be filled:    Support URL   It would come as a surprise to you that you actually might need something like this. I mean, it surprised me too. I didn’t fully grasp what it meant even after hovering on the question mark to reveal insights of what this might be. From what I’ve gathered in teamtreehouse. com, “its purpose is to allow users to get in contact with you if they experience problems, desire new features or want to ask questions about your app. ” Hence, I just used my portfolio as the link.     Build   This is an obvious requirement. And just to bring more light into it, because I didn’t know how it worked at first. Every time you make changes in the code or anywhere in your project, you need to change the build number. So, after having dealt with those warning issues above, I had to increase the build number in project settings, otherwise I couldn’t upload a project with an already existing build number in the app connect.     Rating   This I had no idea too. I initially thought why would I be rating stars of my own app? Stupid, right? Well, just click the edit button beside it and you’ll have a change of perspective.   	   Copyright   I’m not running a company, so I also googled what I could possibly put here. I was wondering if I could actually use 2019 iOS Junkie, but maybe not. So, I just used my name instead.     General App Information and Contact Information   I had to fill out all details with fields referring to name, address, contact number, and email address. Otherwise, it will turn red and not submit for review when you have to.  Post submission: I encountered a rejection. Yes, you can’t have all the fun yet. They sent me this email Below it was a screenshot of where in my app particularly went wrong. I changed my Information Property List with just one line of sentence that has to do with my location privacy usage to Laundry City would like to use your current location to display it on the app, also for directions and estimations of distance. It is secure and private. It’s much longer and I hope it’s worth it. "

    "title": "A Free Blog Using Mundana Jekyll Theme In Github Pages",
    "body": "2019/09/27 - This might be too technical for a non computer savvy to be doing, so I’ve formulated this article to help guide you in creating one of your own. If you want your blog to be in a subdirectory just like my blog iosjunkie. com/blog, then you might want to see this first: It really helped me setup a blog as a subdirectory of my domain. I only had to create another repository blog and cloned that repository into my computer. Then I copied Mundana’s contents from Github into the blog folder. Next is you’ll have to setup the config. yml.  If your site is in root, for baseurl, make sure this is set to baseurl: ‘’. In my case it’s baseurl: ‘/blog’. The first few lines of config. yml is straightforward. You’ll have to change those values. Make sure to change the author attributes as well as the default author under defaults. Whenever you post something new, you don’t have to indicate a meta for layout, author and avatar anymore. Now, this is what makes life easier. With this dashboard, you don’t have to explicity input a meta for your title anymore. Although, you might need to put in the categories, permalink, or tags in your metadata field if you wish to add some. It’s not a perfect system, uploading a photo here can be a pain. Which is why I decided to move a photo asset in the /assets/images/ directory manually every time, because it saves the photo in my /blog folder when I upload using jekyll-admin. It’s still a great interface I’m telling you. You can preview your markdown side by side what you’ve written or by toggling preview only. The texteditor isn’t much, but it’ll do more than just using an ordinary one. Install this admin dashboard interface on your Gemfile by adding jekyll-admin to it: group :jekyll_plugins do  gem 'jekyll-feed'  gem 'jekyll-sitemap'  gem 'jekyll-paginate'  gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'  gem 'jekyll-admin'endSave the file and go to terminal/CMD. Type bundle or bundle install to install the gem, but make sure Ruby is installed in your system. You will only be launching this locally. So, everytime you wan to use jekyll-admin, type this on terminal bundle exec jekyll serve --watchthen go to localhost:4000/admin Posting: I catch myself looking at sample posts whenever I create a new post. You might need to if you’re not familiar with the jekyll format or on how to use markdown. So, I renamed the _post folder to post and added post to my . gitignore. It’s not necessary to create another _post folder back, but if you’re not using the jekyll-admin or if you’re just using a text editor, then you should create it again. Creating Pages: Create your pages in _pages, but there’s one very important matter to discuss here. You need a permalink meta for every page you make. Otherwise, the url will become /_pages/your_new_page.  Automating: You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening Automator. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new workflow, then choose to run shell script like so: Type in what you’d normally type on your terminal. cd /Directory/To/Your/Blogsource ~/. bash_profilebundle exec jekyll serve --watchIf you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening localhost:4000/admin on your browser. That’s how you’ll know if it works. And if it does, you may close the Automator and it’ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github. "
