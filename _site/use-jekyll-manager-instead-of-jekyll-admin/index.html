First mentioned as the “Citadel of București” in 1459, it became the residence of the famous Wallachian prince Vlad III the Impaler. Early 18th century woodcut of Bucharest: The Ottomans appointed Greek administrators (Phanariotes) to run the town from the 18th century. A short-lived revolt initiated by Tudor Vladimirescu in 1821 led to the end of the rule of Constantinople Greeks in Bucharest. [19] The Old Princely Court (Curtea Veche) was erected by Mircea Ciobanul in the mid-16th century. Under subsequent rulers, Bucharest was established as the summer residence of the royal court. During the years to come, it competed with Târgoviște on the status of capital city after an increase in the importance of southern Muntenia brought about by the demands of the suzerain power – the Ottoman Empire. Bucharest finally became the permanent location of the Wallachian court after 1698 (starting with the reign of Constantin Brâncoveanu). Partly destroyed by natural disasters and rebuilt several times during the following 200 years, and hit by Caragea’s plague in 1813–14, the city was wrested from Ottoman control and occupied at several intervals by the Habsburg Monarchy (1716, 1737, 1789) and Imperial Russia (three times between 1768 and 1806). It was placed under Russian administration between 1828 and the Crimean War, with an interlude during the Bucharest-centred 1848 Wallachian revolution. Later, an Austrian garrison took possession after the Russian departure (remaining in the city until March 1857). On 23 March 1847, a fire consumed about 2,000 buildings, destroying a third of the city. "

GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll, so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all. What is Jekyll?: Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator. You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server. Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free. "

We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically.  Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction. The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals. The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated? We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living. "

Written in the 1920s, the book was part of a series which also included The Adventures of a Grain of Dust and A Year in the Wonderland of Trees, all of which were supposed to introduce children to the world of Natural Sciences. In each of them, Hawksworth personifies the natural object he is exploring, and using a mixture of folk tales, scientific facts and colloquial, friendly explanations guides the reader through the history of the natural world. It’s a real thrill of a ride, dramatizing the life cycle of supposedly dull things. The Adventures of a Grain of Dust begins even more loudly than Pebble: I don’t want you to think that I’m boasting, but I do believe I’m one of the greatest travellers that ever was; and if anybody, living or dead, has ever gone through with more than I have I’d like to hear about it.  Hallam Hawksworth was the pen-name of teacher Francis Blake Atkinson. He was married to the author Eleanor Stackhouse Atkinson, author of the children’s classic Greyfriars Bobby, which was based on the (supposedly) true story of a Scottish dog who spent fourteen years guarding his masters grave.

(If you don’t want Bundler to install the gems, use jekyll new myblog --skip-bundle. ) By default, the Jekyll site installed by jekyll new uses a gem-based theme called Minima. With gem-based themes, some of the directories and files are stored in the theme-gem, hidden from your immediate view.

As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end. It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life. "

When you run bundle exec jekyll serve, Bundler uses the gems and versions as specified in Gemfile. lock to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.

    "body": "There are lots of powerful things you can do with the Markdown editor If you’ve gotten pretty comfortable with writing in Markdown, then you may enjoy some more advanced tips about the types of things you can do with Markdown! As with the last post about the editor, you’ll want to be actually editing this post as you read it so that you can see all the Markdown code we’re using. Special formatting: As well as bold and italics, you can also use some other special formatting in Markdown when the need arises, for example:  strike through ==highlight== *escaped characters*Writing code blocks: There are two types of code elements which can be inserted in Markdown, the first is inline, and the other is block. Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks: . my-link {  text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Rouge.  Reference lists: The quick brown jumped over the lazy. Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference. Full HTML: Perhaps the best part of Markdown is that you’re never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Markdown editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits!

    "body": "The first mass-produced book to deviate from a rectilinear format, at least in the United States, is thought to be this 1863 edition of Red Riding Hood, cut into the shape of the protagonist herself with the troublesome wolf curled at her feet. Produced by the Boston-based publisher Louis Prang, this is the first in their “Doll Series”, a set of five “die-cut” books, known also as shape books — the other titles being Robinson Crusoe, Goody Two-Shoes (also written by Red Riding Hood author Lydia Very), Cinderella, and King Winter. An 1868 Prang catalogue would later claim that such “books in the shape of a regular paper Doll… originated with us”.  It would seem the claim could also extend to die cut books in general, as we can’t find anything sooner, but do let us know in the comments if you have further light to shed on this! Such books are, of course, still popular in children’s publishing today, though the die cutting is not now limited to mere outlines, as evidenced in a beautiful 2014 version of the same Little Red Riding Hood story. The die cut has also been employed in the non-juvenile sphere as well, a recent example being Jonathan Safran Foer’s ambitious Tree of Codes. As for this particular rendition of Charles Perrault’s classic tale, the text and design is by Lydia Very (1823-1901), sister of Transcendentalist poet Jones Very. The gruesome ending of the original - which sees Little Red Riding Hood being gobbled up as well as her grandmother - is avoided here, the gore giving way to the less bloody aims of the morality tale, and the lesson that one should not disobey one’s mother.

You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run jekyll serve, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated. To add new posts, simply add a file in the _posts directory that follows the convention YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post. ext and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets: {% highlight ruby %}def print_hi(name) puts “Hi, #{name}”endprint_hi(‘Tom’)#=&gt; prints ‘Hi, Tom’ to STDOUT. {% endhighlight %} Check out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.

Makes me understand a lot of Swift stuff that I never imagined to be digging into. Most of this article is coming from his tutorial and I’ve also included his video in case anyone’s interested. Async is concurrent. It does not wait for something to finish for it to start working. When you hear async, think low priority, background, and fetching data. That much I know. Fernando Martín Ortiz is another iOS developer who’s talked about this. The callback hell he says. Callback hell looks exactly like our picture above. We must refrain from using callbacks with our async functions to avoid spaghetti like codes. Instead, like Let’s Build That App, use Futures. Whatever the hell that means. Kidding aside, it actually means that it has to return something in the future instead of making a callback. Read more about his thoughts on that here. Now let me dive into Let’s Build That App’s (LBTA) precious little code from his video tutorial. In this video, he shows how to convert a callback async function into a future async function. There’s a lot of code here that’ll overwhelm a newbie. enum NetworkError: Error {  case url  case statusCode  case standard}Let’s start with the simplest tiniest detail that we have to wrap our brains with. If you’re a newbie, you might be intimidated from using enums. I know I do. NetworkError is just a name here and you can change it however you like. It inherits an Error which has no requirements of its own, you can declare conformance on any custom type you create. Hence, url, statusCode, and standard are just made up by LBTA. You can add more cases of your own words. In the end, these cases will be printed as strings anyway. For example, case url when printed print(NetworkError. url) will return “url”. func fetchSomethingAsyncAwait(url: String) throws -&gt; Data? {  guard let dummyURL = URL(string: url) else {    throw NetworkError. url  }    var data: Data?  var response: URLResponse?  var error: Error?    // Semaphore  let semaphore = DispatchSemaphore(value: 0)		  URLSession. shared. dataTask(with: dummyURL) { (d, r, e) in    data = d    response = r    error = e        semaphore. signal()  }. resume()    // this will return a result, doing this will just get rid of the warning  // but its still functional without assigning it to an underscore  _ = semaphore. wait(timeout: . distantFuture)    if let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpURLResponse. statusCode &gt; 300 {    throw NetworkError. statusCode  }    if error != nil {    throw NetworkError. standard  }    return data}This is a Future. You know when you see one because it needs to return something, Data?. This is a function that can throw an error. So every time you use this function, you must always put it inside a do try catch. do {  let data = `try` fetchSomethingAsyncAwait(url:  http://google. com )} catch {  print( Failed to Fetch stuff:  , error)  return}If this catches an error, it might print something like “Failed to Fetch stuff: statusCode”. But the most intriguing part of his code is the semaphore. He scheduled the return to execute after the URLSession has finished its task. If there was no semaphore, then his data might return nil. That’s because he didn’t initialize data when he first created it and it is an optional. With this semaphore superpower, he was able to ask the main thread to wait until a signal() has been found in the distant future. URLSession is the async here, and it is making another thread in the background. Once URLSession’s task reached til the end of its closure, the signal will ask the main thread to continue. if let httpURLResponse = response as? HTTPURLResponse, httpURLResponse. statusCode &gt; 300 is the next thing after coming back to the main thread, then the if error != nil. This way, if no error has been thrown, the return data will surely have a value to return, otherwise, it returns nil. "

    "title": "Codable JSON Parsing",
    "body": "2019/10/03 - One of the reasons why you should learn this is, first, because you’re an iOS developer. You need to trim down the size of your app by avoiding 3rd party frameworks. Now, let’s look at the code done by Code Pro. let singleDictJSON =      {     foodName :  Banana ,     calories : 100  }   . data(using: . utf8)!class Food: Codable {  let foodName: String  let calories: Int    init( foodName: String, calories: Int ){    self. foodName = foodName    self. calories = calories  }}We are going to decode the json dictionary above. It is in UTF8 for a reason. That is, it allows us to decode it into an object that is an instance of the class Food. Another requirement for us to be able decode or encode is to make the class inherit Codable. Decode is just a fancy way of saying “from json to swift object”. let foodDecoder = JSONDecoder()do {  let foodResult = try foodDecoder. decode(Food. self, from: singleDictJSON)  print(foodResult. foodName)  print(foodResult. calories)} catch {  print( Failed to decode the food: \(error. localizedDescription) )}Provided that singleDictJSON conforms to the Food class then it should not throw an error. However say you removed calories and its value, it will throw an error when decoding it into a Food object. If you stick to that, without a calories in the json, then you’d have to make the calories variable in your class optional, as well as the calories in the initializer. If this is the case, then foodResult. calories will have a value of nil and will not throw an error if the json does not contain calories. let apple = Food(foodName:  Apple , calories: 80)let jsonEncoder = JSONEncoder()jsonEncoder. outputFormatting = . prettyPrinteddo {  let jsonData = try jsonEncoder. encode(apple)  if let jsonString = String(data: jsonData, encoding: . utf8) {    print(jsonString)  }} catch {  print( Failed to decode the food: \(error. localizedDescription) )}What you see is just the reverse of the previous code. It’s pretty simple isn’t it? Encode is just another way of saying “from object to json”. . prettyPrinted is just a writing option that uses white space and indentation to make the output more readable in the console as opposed to a more compact string. If you have no plans on using print on the jsonString, then you don’t have to make it pretty. Here’s a more elaborate code, also taken from Code Pro’s video tutorial. let dogOwnerJSONData =    [  {     name :  Jameson ,     age : 35,     dogs : [      {         dog_name :  Bryce ,         breed :  Pug ,         age : 7      },      {         dog_name :  Furby ,         breed :  Golden Retriever ,         age : 2      }    ]  },  {     name :  Liza ,     age : 30  }]   . data(using: . utf8)!Woah! That’s a bigger structure with a more complex pattern. Here, one of the owners don’t actually own a dog. Not even one. That’s insane! struct Dog: Codable {  let name: String  let breed: String  let age: Int    private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {    case name =  dog_name     case breed    case age  }}Woah! That’s even more insane. We’re using CodingKeys now to map to each attributes available for this struct. FYI, structs can also inherit from Codable. Why are we doing the CodingKeys enum? Well, that’s because the dog_name in our json isn’t compliant with the struct’s dog’s name attribute. It will throw an error if we don’t do anything about it. If you’re using CodingKeys, you can’t just map just the one with a different key in the json. Like I said, you have to map to each and every attribute in your struct. struct Owner: Codable {  let name: String  let age: Int  let dogs: [Dog]?}It’s a bit toned down now. Dogs is now just an optional and it will do just fine if the owner doesn’t have a dog. No error will throw. It’s imperative to note that dogs is an array here. let dogOwnerDecoder = JSONDecoder()do {  let dogOwners = try dogOwnerDecoder. decode([Owner]. self, from: dogOwnerJSONData)} catch {  print( Failed to decode the dog owners: \(error. localizedDescription) )}This is familiar, but there’s one tiny difference. We have more than one owner in our json, hence we need an array of Owner like this [Owner]. self. So that’s how you decode an array. "

    "title": "Why I Prefer Cloud Firestore Than Realtime Database",
    "body": "2019/10/02 - This is just a brief insight on why I prefer using Firestore. At first, I was hesitant to dive into Firestore, because I thought there wasn’t really much difference. I saw videos and tutorials of Firestore and it baffled me even more. So, I stayed with Firebase Realtime Database for a little long while, until I started with another Xcode project. I delved into why Firestore might be a better fit. Initially, all I understood was Firebase RD will charge you depending on bandwidth usage, while Firestore will charge on writes and reads. I was intimidated by that. The key is to make the writes and reads as minimal as possible to lessen the cost. In my previous personal project, I used Firebase RD. I have a web app for it and iOS app. Both coded by me. I was wondering why it always took so long to read from Firebase. Then I realized, I created a tree structure and whenever I tried to access the root’s value, it grabs all the branches along with it making my succeeding read queries redundant. It loads a very heavy amount of information as my database grew. That’s how I came to a decision to start using Firestore. Collections. Documents. You must’ve read those before. It’s confusing, I know. That’s how Firestore works. Think of it this way. Collections are Folders, and Documents are files that can contain a pointer to a sub Collection. Documents contain the attributes and its values. Collections only contain Documents. For example:  Customer (Collection)     Jane (Document)         address: “In the woods”           age: 16           Orders (sub Collection)             2019-1-19 (Document)                 item: “Pizza”                                    I hope you see the pattern now. Collections always contain Documents, and Documents can contain Collections. What makes it better than Firebase DB? Well, whenever you reference to collection(“Customer”). document(“Jane”), you won’t be including Orders in your read. Thereby, reducing the load. I guess you can say it’s faster this way. You only get to access the address and age of Jane. If you want to get her orders as well, then reference to collection(“Customer”). document(“Jane”). collection(“Orders”). You can loop through all her orders thereafter. No matter how deep your tree becomes with Firestore, you won’t be able to directly access its sub collections and that cuts down a lot of loading time and heaviness. "

That’s because you can only use @State with local properties in the struct view. Let’s see his code one more time. import Combineclass ListDataSource: BindableObject {	var willChange = PassthroughSubject&lt;Void, Never&gt; ()		var rowModels = [CustomRowModel] () {		willSet {			willChange. send()		}	}}In this tutorial, that’s all the code we need. Just kidding. There’s one more: struct ContentView: View {	@ObjectBinding var datasource = ListDataSource()		// to access the rowModels array	datasource. rowModels}Notice here that he used @ObjectBinding instead of @State. If you want a hold of the state of a class, then you must use @ObjectBinding instead and that class should inherit from BindableObject protocol, which requires that you have a PassthroughSubject. In order to use PassthroughSubject, import Combine first. You can substitude willChange to didChange. Heck, it’s just a variable name. But if you do, also change the willSet to didSet. willChange. send() will notify the subscribed view, which in this case is ContentView, of any changes done to rowModels array. "

As you can see, I have two labels in place of my collection view. It’s simple to do, and you’ll be surprised for it. I copied most of the code from Taha Sönmez post on Medium. I believe he explains this in great detail. Although if you’re an intermediate Swift programmer, you might not need the explanation anymore. He did it on a tableview, while this code I’m going to show you is done on a collection view. There’s only 3 lines of code difference. // EmptyView. swiftextension UICollectionView {  func setEmptyView(title: String, message: String) {    let emptyView = UIView(frame: CGRect(x: self. center. x, y: self. center. y, width: self. bounds. size. width, height: self. bounds. size. height))    let titleLabel = UILabel()    let messageLabel = UILabel()    titleLabel. translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false    messageLabel. translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false    titleLabel. textColor = UIColor. black    titleLabel. font = UIFont(name:  HelveticaNeue-Bold , size: 18)    messageLabel. textColor = UIColor. lightGray    messageLabel. font = UIFont(name:  HelveticaNeue-Regular , size: 17)    emptyView. addSubview(titleLabel)    emptyView. addSubview(messageLabel)    titleLabel. centerYAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. centerYAnchor). isActive = true    titleLabel. centerXAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. centerXAnchor). isActive = true    messageLabel. topAnchor. constraint(equalTo: titleLabel. bottomAnchor, constant: 20). isActive = true    messageLabel. leftAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. leftAnchor, constant: 20). isActive = true    messageLabel. rightAnchor. constraint(equalTo: emptyView. rightAnchor, constant: -20). isActive = true    titleLabel. text = title    messageLabel. text = message    messageLabel. numberOfLines = 0    messageLabel. textAlignment = . center    // The only tricky part is here:    self. backgroundView = emptyView  }  func restore() {    self. backgroundView = nil  }}After extending the UICollectionView, go back to the implementation of your collection view. Add this code in your numberOfItemsInSection: func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {    if orders?. count ?? 0 == 0 {      collectionView. setEmptyView(title:  You don't have any orders yet.  , message:  Your orders will be in here.  )    } else {      collectionView. restore()    }    return orders?. count ?? 0}Restoring is essential here. You wouldn’t want to have the empty view when your collection view reloads and holds data. "

More importantly, you already have the GoogleService-Info. plist in your Xcode project. It is important because it contains your bundle identifier. Without Firebase knowing your bundle identifier, you can’t proceed to enabling the Cloud messaging. We’re not doing what’s in the picture. It’s just a formality.

On the toolbar, click Keychain Access beside File In this dropdown menu, Certificate Assistant -&gt; Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority Enter your credentials into the text fields and choose Save to disk. Then go to Apple Developer. For this, you need a paid developer account which costs $99.  Open Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles Navigate to Identifiers Click on the current project you are working on.  Beside the Push Notifications, click Configure.  Depending on which environment you are, click Create Certificate Choose a file -&gt; Upload the CertificateSigningRequest. certSigningRequest you just created.  Continue and download aps_development. cer. Once that is done, you will have a . cert file on your desktop. Now let’s convert that to . p12. Still, using the Keychain Access.  File -&gt; Import Items -&gt; Select your . cert file Drag that file to System, assuming you are in login in the Keychains sidebar.  Drag it back from System to login. You now have a duplicate, but you’ll only need the most recent.  Select My Certificates in the Category.  Select the most recent certificate pertaining to your project, and right-click.  Click Export “Apple Development IOS Push Services: your. project…” Make sure to export it in . p12 format.  It will then ask you to create a password to protect this certficate. Give it one and click ok. In order to test this while under development, you need a Provisioning Profile for development to authorize your devices to run an app that is not yet published on the App Store.  Open Certificates, Identifiers &amp; Profiles Select Profiles Generate a Profile Select iOS App Development and continue Select your App ID and continue Select the iOS Development certificate of the App ID you have chosen in the previous step, then click Continue.  Select the iOS devices that you want to include in the Provisioning Profile, then click Continue. Make sure to select all the devices you want to use for your testing.  Name the provisioning profile whatever you want and generate.  Download the provisioning profile and open it to install.  If it crashes your Xcode, just go to your Xcode project settings -&gt; Signing &amp; Capabilities -&gt; Disable Automatically Manage Signing -&gt; Import the provisioning profile. To enable the cloud messaging feature, go to https://console. cloud. google. com/ -&gt; Search for your Firebase project and select it -&gt; APIs and Services -&gt; + ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES-&gt; Search for Firebase Cloud Messaging API -&gt; click Enable. In your Firebase console, navigate to Project Settings -&gt; Cloud Messaging -&gt; iOS app configuration -&gt; APNs Certificates -&gt; Upload the . p12 file here, then enter the password for this certificate. That’s all you need for now to allow Cloud Messaging on your iOS device. It’s like a term for Remote Push Notifications. I was baffled at that at first. Now this is the part where we detect changes in the firebase database. If you haven’t installed the firebase CLI yet, please do so.  Create a directory where you want to put the cloud functions code. In my case, I created triggers directory under my Xcode project directory. Laundry City/triggers ‘cd triggers` In the terminal, type firebase init functions, but make sure you’re logged in with firebase cli.  Choose javascript and type y as in yes to any remaining questions from the cli.  Open index. js and create your function such as below:// index. jsconst functions = require('firebase-functions');const admin = require('firebase-admin');admin. initializeApp();exports. sendNewChangesNotification = functions. database. ref('houses/{house}/items/{item}/'). onWrite((change, context) =&gt; {  var topic =  Serenity ;		  // A message that contains the notification that devices will receive	  var message = {   notification: {    title: 'New Quantity',    body: change. after. val(). product + ' now has ' + change. after. val(). tentative + ' new items. '   }  };  // Using Cloud Messaging to create notification  return admin. messaging(). sendToTopic(topic, message). then(function (response) {    console. log('Successfully sent message:', response);    return null;  }). catch(function (error) {    throw new Error( Error sending message: , error);  });})First thing to note here is, you won’t start your ref with the Project ID. . Instead, the branch below it. The ones in the brackets are ids, which varies. This will detect any write or changes happening in that reference. It will catch the changes in the change parameter. Thereby, allowing access to the new tentative value in change. after. val(). tentative from the reference houses/1/items/2/tentative. 1 and 2 here are just examples of IDs. sendNewChangesNotification is just a variable. You can change it however you like. When everything is in place, go back to terminal and deploy it with firebase deploy. Now, you have a listener or a trigger whenever your items have been changed or added. Your AppDelegate. swift should look like this. This firebase sample is as instructed in the documentation. To send a notification, admin. messaging. send will do the trick. But you have to provide a token, topic, or a condition. Token is generated by the AppDelegate and is uploaded to Firebase automatically. If you specify a specific token, then only the device with that token will receive the notification. Topic is what its name suggests. To subscribe to a topic, add this to wherever you need to put in your Xcode project: Messaging. messaging(). subscribe(toTopic:  Serenity ) { error in     print( Subscribed to weather topic )    }Condition can be something like you want to send this to notification to subscribers of more than one topic. For example:  'Serenity' in topics || 'Manor' in topics . Further documentation about this. "

    "body": "2019/09/30 - I was hesitant in making a change at first, since I just started blogging using Jekyll. Looking at how updates are freshly being added to the jekyll-admin library made me think it’s more intuitive. I am wrong. However, the upgrades done in jekyll-manager isn’t really all that drastic. They still haven’t got a fix for when selecting the image metadata. It is still http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/…jpg when I select an image from the static files. I wonder why they haven’t dealt this yet. This should have been the turning point of their fork. Instead, a few UI changes have been made. Some, impressive.  This is my favorite part about jekyll-manager and to be honest, the only thing I care about, really. Directories can be navigated to now, therefore making uploading a hell of a lot easier, now that I’m confident to use this dashboard for uploading images. I no longer have to drag and drop using Finder for this. The metadata too has changed. It is, by default, hidden and expandable. It’s quite confusing why it’s called a FRONT MATTER, instead of metadata. And by default too, layout is the first metadata you’ll be able to see. There’s a select dropdown for the choices for layout. Since in our config. yml, layout is set to post by default, then you can choose to remove this metadata field. tags has this cool feature that allows you to select from previous used tags. It’s just sad that it doesn’t work the same with categories. Hence, when typing multiple categories, just separate them with spaces and not a comma. The text editor’s panel for tools is now dark but overall, it works the same and still no Grammarly functionality. I mean Grammarly is disabled when using the text editor, but not on other text fields.  Bummer. For the most part, it looks almost exactly like jekyll-admin and better, but I don’t understand why there isn’t any noticeable changes in jekyll-admin that will make it better than the 2 years ago maintaned code of jekyll-manager. Automating: You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening Automator. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new workflow, then choose to run shell script like so: Type in what you’d normally type on your terminal. cd /Directory/To/Your/Blogsource ~/. bash_profilebundle exec jekyll serve --watchIf you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening localhost:4000/admin on your browser. That’s how you’ll know if it works. And if it does, you may close the Automator and it’ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github. "

    "title": "Custom Table Cell With SwiftUI",
    "body": "2019/09/28 - First of all, thanks to Scott Smith for helping me understand this. I know it can be another learning curve to start learning SwiftUI if you’ve only begun diving into becoming an iOS developer. It’s daunting at first, but I hope it can be simple too for many newbies. Now, I haven’t gotten my hands on Mac OS Catalina yet, so I can’t actually demonstrate my own version of this tutorial properly if I can’t show you the canvas, which isn’t available in Mojave yet, myself. To make a table, add the List() in your ContentView struct ContentView : View {	@State var data = [ Stevens ,  Chloe ,  Frank ]		var body: some View {		List(data, id: \. self) { item in			CustomRow(name: item)		}	}}The id here is what confused me as a beginner. How Scott wrote and explained it is that \. self is meant to give identification automatically to each string from data itself. If you created a more comlex data structure, then you’ll probably just have to specify the id in that structure and assign it a value of UUID(), which returns unique id number.  @State on the other hand is something that will notify if there are any changes in the data array and update whichever component is using that variable. The item represents each item in the data array and it is being passed as an argument to another struct, CustomRow. It’s pretty self explainable what can be done next to create the table cell here. We only have to put in the components we need to complete a single cell in this struct. struct CustomRow : View {	var name: String		var body: some View {		Text(name)	}}If we didn’t need to create a custom table cell, we need not create the CustomRow struct and just use Text(item) instead. In the body of our CustomRow is where you can throw in all the components you’re going to need. So, I thought to myself. That wasn’t daunting at all. You no longer have to specify how many sections and rows, no need to get the cell identifier off from the storyboard, which reduces a hell lot of code to write. It’s just that all UI designs you might have in mind will now have to be written in code which sucks. If you went on with the video tutorial, you might want some answers regarding @ObjectBinding and how it works. Here’s my explanation. "

    "title": "Issues With My First App Store Connect Submission",
    "body": "2019/09/27 - It was my first app submission to the app store. I mean, well, I hadn’t submitted it for review yet, but it already detected a couple of issues that needs dealing with. I uploaded it to app connect for 6 times until I got it right. The first issue I had to deal with only needed a little bit of tweaking in my project’s Signing and Capabilities. From there, I added a Capability known as ‘Push Notifications’. The second one is because of a deprecated API. I tried updating a cocoapod library “Firebase/Auth” after finding out that this utilizes UIWebView. For some reason, I can’t get update working on a single pod. Prior to this, I thought Facebook Core and Facebook Login were the culprits, knowing those would open a UIWebView for me to sign into Facebook. I guess I found a fix on Github issues, which helped other developers with what might have been a similar problem. pod 'FacebookCore', '~&gt; 0. 9. 0'pod 'FacebookLogin', '~&gt; 0. 9. 0'After trying this out, it didn’t actually help with the second issue. Until, I finally decided to update all the pods with just a simple pod updateI didn’t know most of my pods were actually not up-to-date until I did that. Voila, I didn’t get another warning after uploading my project to App Connect. There were just a few more things that needed filling up. Below are things that needed to be filled:    Support URL   It would come as a surprise to you that you actually might need something like this. I mean, it surprised me too. I didn’t fully grasp what it meant even after hovering on the question mark to reveal insights of what this might be. From what I’ve gathered in teamtreehouse. com, “its purpose is to allow users to get in contact with you if they experience problems, desire new features or want to ask questions about your app. ” Hence, I just used my portfolio as the link.     Build   This is an obvious requirement. And just to bring more light into it, because I didn’t know how it worked at first. Every time you make changes in the code or anywhere in your project, you need to change the build number. So, after having dealt with those warning issues above, I had to increase the build number in project settings, otherwise I couldn’t upload a project with an already existing build number in the app connect.     Rating   This I had no idea too. I initially thought why would I be rating stars of my own app? Stupid, right? Well, just click the edit button beside it and you’ll have a change of perspective.   	   Copyright   I’m not running a company, so I also googled what I could possibly put here. I was wondering if I could actually use 2019 iOS Junkie, but maybe not. So, I just used my name instead.     General App Information and Contact Information   I had to fill out all details with fields referring to name, address, contact number, and email address. Otherwise, it will turn red and not submit for review when you have to.  Post submission: I encountered a rejection. Yes, you can’t have all the fun yet. They sent me this email Below it was a screenshot of where in my app particularly went wrong. I changed my Information Property List with just one line of sentence that has to do with my location privacy usage to Laundry City would like to use your current location to display it on the app, also for directions and estimations of distance. It is secure and private. It’s much longer and I hope it’s worth it. "

    "title": "A Free Blog Using Mundana Jekyll Theme In Github Pages",
    "body": "2019/09/27 - This might be too technical for a non computer savvy to be doing, so I’ve formulated this article to help guide you in creating one of your own. If you want your blog to be in a subdirectory just like my blog iosjunkie. com/blog, then you might want to see this first: It really helped me setup a blog as a subdirectory of my domain. I only had to create another repository blog and cloned that repository into my computer. Then I copied Mundana’s contents from Github into the blog folder. Next is you’ll have to setup the config. yml.  If your site is in root, for baseurl, make sure this is set to baseurl: ‘’. In my case it’s baseurl: ‘/blog’. The first few lines of config. yml is straightforward. You’ll have to change those values. Make sure to change the author attributes as well as the default author under defaults. Whenever you post something new, you don’t have to indicate a meta for layout, author and avatar anymore. Now, this is what makes life easier. With this dashboard, you don’t have to explicity input a meta for your title anymore. Although, you might need to put in the categories, permalink, or tags in your metadata field if you wish to add some. It’s not a perfect system, uploading a photo here can be a pain. Which is why I decided to move a photo asset in the /assets/images/ directory manually every time, because it saves the photo in my /blog folder when I upload using jekyll-admin. It’s still a great interface I’m telling you. You can preview your markdown side by side what you’ve written or by toggling preview only. The texteditor isn’t much, but it’ll do more than just using an ordinary one. Install this admin dashboard interface on your Gemfile by adding jekyll-admin to it: group :jekyll_plugins do  gem 'jekyll-feed'  gem 'jekyll-sitemap'  gem 'jekyll-paginate'  gem 'jekyll-seo-tag'  gem 'jekyll-admin'endSave the file and go to terminal/CMD. Type bundle or bundle install to install the gem, but make sure Ruby is installed in your system. You will only be launching this locally. So, everytime you wan to use jekyll-admin, type this on terminal bundle exec jekyll serve --watchthen go to localhost:4000/admin Posting: I catch myself looking at sample posts whenever I create a new post. You might need to if you’re not familiar with the jekyll format or on how to use markdown. So, I renamed the _post folder to post and added post to my . gitignore. It’s not necessary to create another _post folder back, but if you’re not using the jekyll-admin or if you’re just using a text editor, then you should create it again. Automating: You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening Automator. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new workflow, then choose to run shell script like so: Type in what you’d normally type on your terminal. cd /Directory/To/Your/Blogsource ~/. bash_profilebundle exec jekyll serve --watchIf you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening localhost:4000/admin on your browser. That’s how you’ll know if it works. And if it does, you may close the Automator and it’ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github. "

			<p>I was hesitant in making a change at first, since I just started blogging using Jekyll. Looking at how updates are freshly being added to the jekyll-admin library made me think it’s more intuitive. I am wrong. However, the upgrades done in jekyll-manager isn’t really all that drastic. They still haven’t got a fix for when selecting the image metadata. It is still http://localhost:4000/blog/assets/images/…jpg when I select an image from the static files. I wonder why they haven’t dealt this yet. This should have been the turning point of their fork. Instead, a few UI changes have been made. Some, impressive.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-29%20at%2011.32.59%20PM.png" alt="assets" /></p>

<p>This is my favorite part about jekyll-manager and to be honest, the only thing I care about, really. Directories can be navigated to now, therefore making uploading a hell of a lot easier, now that I’m confident to use this dashboard for uploading images. I no longer have to drag and drop using Finder for this.</p>

<p>The metadata too has changed. It is, by default, hidden and expandable. It’s quite confusing why it’s called a <code class="highlighter-rouge">FRONT MATTER</code>, instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">metadata</code>. And by default too, <code class="highlighter-rouge">layout</code> is the first metadata you’ll be able to see. There’s a select dropdown for the choices for <code class="highlighter-rouge">layout</code>. Since in our config.yml, layout is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">post</code> by default, then you can choose to remove this metadata field. <code class="highlighter-rouge">tags</code> has this cool feature that allows you to select from previous used tags. It’s just sad that it doesn’t work the same with <code class="highlighter-rouge">categories</code>. Hence, when typing multiple categories, just separate them with spaces and not a comma.</p>

<p>The text editor’s panel for tools is now dark but overall, it works the same and still no Grammarly functionality. I mean <code class="highlighter-rouge">Grammarly</code> is disabled when using the text editor, but not on other text fields.  Bummer.</p>

<p>For the most part, it looks almost exactly like jekyll-admin and better, but I don’t understand why there isn’t any noticeable changes in jekyll-admin that will make it better than the 2 years ago maintaned code of jekyll-manager.</p>

<h3 id="automating">Automating</h3>
<p>You might want to lessen the technicality of going through terminal to go to your blog directory and serving jekyll to access admin. You can do this by opening <code class="highlighter-rouge">Automator</code>. You have this preinstalled on your Mac OS. Create a new <code class="highlighter-rouge">workflow</code>, then choose to run shell script like so:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-02%20at%209.07.22%20PM.png" alt="shell" /></p>

<p>Type in what you’d normally type on your terminal.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd /Directory/To/Your/Blog
source ~/.bash_profile
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run it and everything goes smoothly, try opening <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost:4000/admin</code> on your browser. That’s how you’ll know if it works. And if it does, you may close the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Automator</code> and it’ll ask you to save the script. Save it as Application to your preferred directory. If you ever need to access the admin dashboard of your blog, just double-click like you would on a normal app. You might be surprised. This also works for pushing all your changes to github.</p>
