I bought a pair of Apple Fake Airpods on [Shopee][shp] for Php 1060 including shipping. Yes, that's right! I bought it cheap. It's around $20 and it's worthy, I might add.

I have looked into this for quite some time. I never knew I wanted them so much until I found myself trying to look for a fake one. The original one is just too much for its price. I've read a lot of bad reviews on lower models of TWS until I caught myself reading the reviews of an i500 TWS. There weren't any bad reviews, but I was still skeptic because many TWS do have a defect or two. Some have only one side working, some only work for a week, and some are louder only on one side.

It took risk to buy a fake product not knowing what condition it is in. The product I received had free silicone casing for the shell and a silicone string that holds the pair of airpods together like that of old people eye-glasses. Yeah that thing if you can imagine it.

The sound is great. It fits perfectly. I can't tell it apart from an original one because I never had one. If the music is loud, it is enough to cancel the noise outside.

One of the downsides is that I can't max it out. The sound distorts when the bass is very heavy. Like I have this surround sound effect on my phone. When turned on, it looks like my airpods can't handle that bass. Its not to say it isn't capable of bass. It is capable and sounds magnificent when the surround sound effect is turned off. I can still play some loud party music and the music would be crisp still. It just can't handle the very loud bass or the kind of bass that scatters too much. I don't think I've described it right. 

Another downside would be the latency. It lags when I play a video on streaming sites or even on a downloaded video. It doesn't delay too much, sometimes it can be negligible.

I have tried it both on my iPad and Vivo V9. Recording audio with airpods on my iPad gave me some shit quality, while in my android phone, it is actually crisp. However, the volume is lowered. I might have just spoken too softly on my airpods while I was recording my voice on the Vivo V9.

Overall, I love the fake airpods. I use it all the time. The bluetooth connectivity is as convenient as when using bluetooth headset's, connects instantly.
