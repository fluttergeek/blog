I've seen him talk about how he was hesitant to dive into learning Swift UI. I took his sentiment as my own because I don't really see why I needed to.

Mostly in this video is an ad to [designcode.io][dc] which is still really a quality content. I only knew about Ray Wenderlich, Treehouse, Coursera, and Udemy in regards to taking courses in relation to Xcode, but this is another one. I don't know how long it has existed but Meng To, creator of DesignCode, has been updating his courses profoundly like Sean says. 

I still haven't seen myself using SwiftUI because I haven't upgraded to Catalina yet. And without Catalina, my Xcode would not render the canvas beside my code. It would kinda defeat the purpose of me using SwiftUI if I don't see the changes in my codes. Although that may be the case, I've been watching SwiftUI tutorials since because it seems to get a lot better that I initially thought it'd be.

Considering Sean's talk about his dealings in the SwiftUI realm with DesignCode, I'm now interested to see what I could learn and do too, myself. It took him about seven days to finish the course.

DesignCode's course can be billed annually for $108, which will not renew automatically. But if you choose to subscribe for one month, it would cost you $15, which will renew monthly. So for me, it doesn't look like I'm ready to make that commitment yet of taking his course. Maybe I'll just look for free lessons out there and it'd be wise if you too. Unless you really want to learn the designs and animations part, you might find his course worth every penny.
