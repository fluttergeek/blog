title: Native Messenger App For Mac OS (Review)
---

I'm currently on Mojave and I just thought that it's time I use an app for messenger. It takes quite a while to load Facebook messenger on my Chrome browser. Maybe it's just my internet speed. So I looked for an app on the Mac App Store and there's not much apps out there for native Mac OS app look of Messenger. This is probably the only one out there. The only one I've found at least. I've scrolled deep enough to see there's no other like it. It has decent amount of stars as rating, but does it really live up to it?

What can I say? It really looks native, but it is half-baked. Here's why:
1. The login fields look alright, but the placeholder doesn't say the username can be accepted too. It's just `Email` and `phone number`.
2. The login button is especially horrible looking. Just a plane white button with no rounded edges. Its font is too thin and the spacing around the text of the button is just not well thought of.
3. As you can see on the photo, the user's icon is overlapping the window frame's buttons.
4. Some text like `Chat` is meant to be brighter on this dark mode. It definitely looks more suited to the light mode.
5. The light mode is actually more gray than white.

Other than that, I'm satisfied with the app. I bought it for only a dollar. I'm going to keep on using it because it's way faster than loading the messenger website.
