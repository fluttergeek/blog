My new vertical mouse just arrived as we speak. This is a little different from the [previous](http://iosjunkie.com/blog/using-vertical-mouse-my-take/ "Vertical Mouse") one; It has a wire instead of it being wireless and it feels funny around my hands.

I have now been accustomed to using my previous vertical mouse. It felt rather more comfortable when I wrap my hand around it, but I don't feel the same comfort with this new one. 

However, the purpose of this as a mouse is on point. It doesn't lag like the previous vertical mouse. No lags in scrolling too. But it has friction on my mousepad. So, I removed the mousepad and now I'm using it on top of a wood. It feels much smoother this way.

The color I got is black, though I would've liked it to be the color I've used in the image above which is matte white. Mine has three glossy buttons, not including the left and right-click buttons. Like the image above, it has some kind of tail but it feels like it's in the wrong place.
