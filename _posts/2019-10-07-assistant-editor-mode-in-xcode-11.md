Welcome to the world of Xcode 11 where it's now confusing to find the assistant editor. Well, there it is. It is not in the same place anymore. On the top right corner of the storyboard, there's this `Adjust Editor Options` icon. Just click on that and choose `Assistant`. 

I'm so used to the old icon that it used to be, but now it's just a text only button that is not that easy to navigate to. But why? Are they really pushing developers to use SwiftUI and depend on the canvas instead of our dearest storyboard?

UPDATE: I thought I was the only one who put up an instruction for this. Well, here's a better visual on how to really find it.
