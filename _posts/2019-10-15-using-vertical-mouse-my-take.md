I bought the `Wireless Vertical Mouse Game 800/1600/2400DPI Mice 2-Button` a couple of weeks ago and it just a arrived a week ago. I bought mine in [Shopee][shopee]. It's a marketplace here in the Philippines. I bought it for only Php 445 including freight. That's like almost USD 10. This is brandless and it charges like how you charge with your phone. I guess its battery lasts for a week, or maybe it just turned off. It says in Shopee that it should last more than a month. So, I just recharged mine again today. 

Does it fix the arm strain problem?

I think it does. As a programmer, I thought I was having carpal tunnel syndrome. This happened to me during 2016 after graduating from college. My hands would become painful and even more painful each day. Until I stopped programming. It took me many months of pregabalin/gabapentin and Vitamin B complex to heal from it. It wasn't fully gone but I was more relieved. I went to med school after that, and I haven't encountered the pain again. We don't use keyboards and mouse that much in med school. Then after 2 years, I decided it's not for me at all. 

The past few months I've been trying to get back to programming. The pain starts coming back, so I minimized my computer usage to keep the pain away the day after. I realized that putting my keyboard closer to my lap did the trick. It removed most of the pain. I got more into coding and there is pain when I'm holding the mouse for so long. I guess I shouldn't have rested my palms on top of the mouse if I wasn't really using it. But that just doesn't solve the problem because I will be programming for long hours.

After trying the vertical mouse, things starts to change pretty quickly. I no longer feel the strain in my hands and arms. It reduced the pain to like 90%. The other 10% is when I use the vertical mouse for much longer hours but it's not all that painful and it subsides easily. All these years I thought I had carpal tunnel syndrome. I was misdiagnosed by a Rheumatologist here in Zamboanga. You know why? I told him I have this pain and it includes my pinky and my finger joints as well. He refuses to diagnose it with anything else but `CTS`. I know it wasn't CTS because my pinky is included which shouldn't be the case if it really was CTS. 

As for this vertical mouse model, well, it is brandless and you get what you pay for. I'm not sure why it hangs a bit when I load up a lot of windows or when I'm running out of RAM. It's not that much of a problem though. Most of the time it doesn't hang. But when it does, the left click button kind of acts like a right click and then it feels laggy and not to mention, the scrolling too. For the most part, I'm satisfied with my mouse. It is a wireless mouse, but like most wireless mouse, you need that tiny usb thingy plugged in your computer that allows it to be wireless. Not bluetooth.
