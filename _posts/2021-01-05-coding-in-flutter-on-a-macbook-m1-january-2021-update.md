I've just bought a Macbook Air M1 for the purpose of editing videos and programming in Flutter. I'm going to tell you what that feels like, and it's not so great.

First of all, installing the VS Code. Pffft. Don't you start with the Android Studio. I'm currently working on something that's not a mobile app but using Flutter. I mean, I have to try it. It's 2021 anyway; even though it's still not production-ready yet. Hence, I haven't installed Android Studio or Xcode on my system, for now. What I'm currently using is the ordinary VS Code, not the VS Code insider arm64, which is meant for the m1 chip.

Why? Because I can't seem to load anymore after trying to sync extensions with my ordinary VS Code in my PC. Since then, I had no choice but to use the ordinary VS Code. Up until now, the m1 version crashes even when I leave it in the downloads folder.

The m1 version runs undoubtedly fast when I tried it. The ordinary one lags occasionally and much slower than the m1 version; although technically, it's not called that. I could still code just the way it feels on my windows PC. The problem comes when I try to debug/run my web app on Chrome. I wish there was a Safari option for that but I looked and there's none. Once Chrome runs, the whole system starts to lag a bit more but not too much that you can't move between apps. The thing is every other Mac app slows down when you want to load them. Once you stop the debugging, everything runs smoothly again.

Honestly, I can't wait for a more stable version of VS Code insider so that I can try it then maybe things start to get better. In the meantime, I'm trying out IntelliJ to continue my project. Why? Because it is M1 compatible and I think it's been able to keep the lag to a minimum; which allows me to run more apps on the side. Although, if you've tried IntelliJ or Android Studio, its interface still feels rough to the touch. The other thing you'd be disappointed about is the lack of hot reload when running natively using the IDE's play button.
