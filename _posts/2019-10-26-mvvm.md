There are two MVVM tutorials I've come across. Let's see how similar it is and how we can tell both are MVVM. I will arrange their code in this order: `model`, `view model`, and `controller`. There's an extra in Brian Voong's example.

### First from Brian Voong
```
// Course.swift
struct Course: Decodable {
    id : int
    name: String
    number_of_lessons: Int
}
```
```
// CourseViewModel.swift
struct CourseViewModel {
    let name: String
    let detailTextString: String
    let accessoryType: UITableViewCellAccessoryType
		
    // Dependency Injection (DI)
    init(course: Course) {
        self.name = course.name
				
        if course.number_of_lessons > 35 {
            detailTextString = "Lessons 30+ Check it Out!"
            accessoryType = .detailDisclosureButton
        else {
            detailTextString = "Lessons: \(course.number_of_lessons)"
            accessoryType = .none
        }
    }
}
```
```
// CourseCell.swift
class CourseCell: UITableViewCell {
    var courseViewModel: CourseViewModel! {
        didSet {
           textLabel?.text = courseViewModel.name
           detailTextLabel?.text = courseViewModel.detailTextString
           accessoryType = courseViewModel.accessryType
        }
}
```
```
// CoursesController.swift
fileprivate func fetchData() {
    Service.shared.fetchCourses { (courses, err) in
        if let err = err { return }
        
        self.courseViewModels = courses?.map({ return CourseViewModel(course: $0)}) ?? []
        self.tableView.reloadData()
}
```

This fetchData function is only available inside CoursesController.swift file, because it is a fileprivate. Brian Voong created a `Service.swift` file from where this closure comes from which is not a relevant topic for this post. When accessed accordingly, it can be available to any classes but within CoursesController.swift file. But that's not what we're here to talk about. This function calls an API that returns us the courses, which is of type Course. Inside the closure, it is taking that `courses` array into a CourseViewModel array. The CourseViewModel array will then be the data source of the `tableView`.

### Second is from Rebeloper
```
// User.swift
struct User {
    let name: String
    let age: Int
    backgroundColor: UIColor
		
    init(name: String, age: Int, backgroundColor: UIColor) {
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        self.backgrouundColor = backgroundColor
    }
}
```
```
// RootViewModel.swift
class RootViewModel {
    let user: User
    
    init(user: User) {
        self.user = user
    }
}
```
```
// RootViewController.swift
var viewModel: RootViewModel! {
    didSet {
        view.backgroundColor = viewModel.user.backgroundColor
        navigationItem.title = "\(viewModel.user.name), \(viewModel.user.age)"
    }
}

viewDidLoad() {
    let user = User(name: "Alex", age: 36, backgroundColor: .white)
    viewModel = RootViewModel(user: user)
}
```

Here, you won't see a `tableView`. Good! Cause maybe you though we need a table to do the MVVM. 

I think Rebeloper's code doesn't really bring out the need for MVVM. We can see how he accessed the `User` model inside the view controller. While in Brian's example, he did the same thing but indirectly. But anyway, I guess that's how it works. Just another construct that looks similar to a `Model`.

### Take

Both examples almost have the same objective.

To separate the view logic from the model logic and vice versa by creating an intermediary called a `ViewModel`. 

Why should we do this? Who knows. I know MVC makes sense, but I don’t know how this does. We still have the controller and it makes it all the more confusing because it doesn’t say `MVVMC`. 

Hold on, let's find a better example to see why MVVM is talked about by developers. These examples don't exaggerate enough why we need to use MVVM. It looks pretty redundant. This here is an example by [iOS Quickstart][quick]:

![mvvm](/blog/assets/images/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-26%20at%208.16.49%20PM.png)

Now it's starting to make sense. These static functions inside this ViewModel are called `Translation Codes`. Blame `iOS Quickstart` if I'm wrong about that. Without the MVVM architecture, we'll be putting these translation codes inside our view controller and it gets messier there. The `VM` of MVVM is just another way to create another file or folder to store the mess elsewhere if you consider these translation codes a mess, because I do. 

Remember I said `MVVMC`? Well, I thought the controller has its own abbreviation like in `MVC`. Turns out the V in M`V`VM stands for View Controller. Invisible `C` right there. I thought the view there was like table cell or something.
