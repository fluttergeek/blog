This is one of the coolest flutter packages I've come across. I've had a little bit of experimenting with SwiftUI before, and it's now brought here in Flutter. Although, not entirely similar, but it does take away plenty of lines of codes.

This is not one of those state management libraries, nor does it help with state management related activities. It just helps shorten the code so much and I think it's both a blessing and a curse.
