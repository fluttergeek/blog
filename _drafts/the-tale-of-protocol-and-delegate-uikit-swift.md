This topic is most trivial for beginners. Protocol. Delegate. Two words that don't easily make sense to us, Filipinos. Although, I do know what it means. It just takes me a moment to realize what it means. Even though I already know of this topic, the concept still doesn't sink in when I need to use it. Hence, I have now decided to make a story out of it to make it stick.

This begins with two ViewControllers, and that it needs to relay a message back to the first view controller. Does it make sense? No?

Well, it should. The image above says so.
